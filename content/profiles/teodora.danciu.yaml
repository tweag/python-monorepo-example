shortDescription: |
  Teodora is a software engineer with JVM background and a love for functional programming. 
  At Tweag, she has started developing in Haskell, after having played with it for hobby projects and intellectual enjoyment.

bio: |
  Teodora moved to the UK in 2012 in pursuit of transitioning from Java development to Scala - an interest which started as an intuition and ended up shaping her career path, 
  as her understanding and appreciation of functional programming deepened.

  Before joining Tweag, she worked as a Scala developer in various roles that built up her experience in programming and distributed systems.

  She believes that it is possible, and indeed, a duty to reflect core life values in code and system design: clarity, simplicity, integrity, focus - and strives to harmoniously combine principles with pragmatism.

  Teodora takes great joy in working with people and is always trying to find harmony in the team, as well as in the code.
