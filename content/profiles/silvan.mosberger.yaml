shortDescription: |
  Silvan is an active member of the Nix community, specializing in NixOS
  modules and deployment, Nix internals and state-of-the-art improvements. For
  writing actual programs he preferably uses Haskell, but can also use Bash if
  need be.
bio: |
  In 2017 he gained a personal interest in Nix, and promptly switched over from
  macOS to NixOS in the same year. Since his previous go-to language for
  writing programs, Swift, wasn't very usable on Linux, he used this
  opportunity to become more acquainted with Haskell, which has since become
  his new preferred language. From this he has developed a good intuition for
  purely functional programming over the years.

  Up to 2020, Silvan studied computer science at ETH in ZÃ¼rich for his
  bachelors degree. But exhausted from studying, he decided to leave university
  in order to start his programming career with Nix and Haskell, leading him to
  Tweag.

  In his free time, Silvan has an interest in Japanese culture, ranging from
  listening to Enka music, watching Anime, eating Japanese dishes, to studying
  the language itself. Generally he can be found in his natural habitat at
  home, but occasionally he leaves to meet with friends for a cozy movie night.
  His main personality traits are patience, kindness and optimism, but also
  laziness and perfectionism.
