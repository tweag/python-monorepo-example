shortDescription: |
  Simeon is a theoretical physicist who has undergone several transformations.
  A journey through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, computational structural
  biology, a wet lab and renowned research institutions in Germany, Paris and
  New York finally led him back to Paris and to Tweag, where he currently leads
  the data science / engineering team. He is actively working on client
  projects and manages the data team's internal projects. During pre-meeting
  smalltalk, ask him about rock climbing, Argentinian tango or playing the
  piano!
bio: |
  Simeon spent most of his scientific career on doing research
  on Bayesian statistics methods to determine the
  three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. This involved a
  good deal of software engineering in Python and Cython, high-
  performance computing clusters and algorithmic deep-dives
  into the fascinating world of Markov chain Monte Carlo and
  molecular simulation.

  At Tweag, he is profiting from his biology domain knowledge in projects for a
  big pharma company and has honed his statistics and software engineering
  skills in both client and internal projects.  He is also leading the data
  team which involves managing engineers' internal time, supporting the sales
  team in meetings with potential clients and helping with hiring fresh talents
  for the data team.

  His personal interests are probabilistic programming, Bayesian statistics and
  the tooling around it. He also dabbles in Nix and thinks this is a technology
  (data) scientists should try out! For the occasional extra brain tickle, he
  tries to deepen his understanding of Haskell and functional programming
  concepts.

  Outside work, Simeon enjoys climbing steep and high rocks all over Europe,
  dancing Argentinian tango and improvising on the piano.

  Tweagers appreciate Simeon's enthusiasm for life and his ability to be very
  direct while being thoughtful at the same time! Simeon has a strong
  background in mathematical modelisations and a knack for breaking complex
  problems down and explaining them in a way that is easy to understand.
