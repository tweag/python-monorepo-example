shortDescription: |
  A software engineer who is passionate about DevOps and automation.

bio: |
  Ben learned to program BASIC from a ZX Spectrum instruction manual and has
  been fascinated by computers and programming ever since. In high school he
  progressed to C++ and since starting his career has worked professionally in
  many other languages, including C#, Go, Java, Kotlin and PureScript. These
  days he prefers coding in Haskell.

  Over the course of his career, Ben has worked across a variety of industries.
  He began with a brief stint as a games developer before spending a few years
  in finance. He then moved to the Windows division at Microsoft and most
  recently worked for a cryptocurrency startup. This range of experience has
  helped shape his views on how best to practice software engineering. He
  believes that an expressive type system combined with a focus on robust and
  composable abstractions is one of the most effective ways to build reliable
  software at scale.

  He has a long standing interest in build systems and (remembering the dark
  days when Make was the standard) is enthused by recent developments in the
  space. Now at Tweag, he gets to indulge this interest by working with Bazel
  and Nix on the Scalable Build Systems team.

  When not at the keyboard, Ben enjoys climbing, running and reading.
