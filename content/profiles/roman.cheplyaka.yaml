experience:
  - employer: Tweag
    role: Software Engineer
    years: 2018–present
    description:
      - Helping a client improve their systems biology modeling engine
        written in Haskell. Notably, implemented just-in-time compilation of
        mathematical formulas via LLVM, speeding up simulations by 4x–10x.
  - employer: NStack
    role: Software Engineer
    years: 2017–2018
    description:
      - Helped NStack to redesign and evolve their domain-specific language
        implemented in Haskell; improved DSL error messages for syntax and type
        errors; added type inference.  Developed a Haskell library ("libnstack")
        with a low-level C interface to be used by packages in different
        languages. Then developed an R package on top of this library, thus adding
        support for the R language to the NStack platform.
