abstract: >
  In this paper, we give a simple and efficient implementation of reverse-mode
  automatic differentiation, which both extends easily to higher-order
  functions, and has run time and memory consumption linear in the run time of
  the original program. In addition to a formal description of the
  translation, we also describe an implementation of this algorithm, and prove
  its correctness by means of a logical relations argument.
