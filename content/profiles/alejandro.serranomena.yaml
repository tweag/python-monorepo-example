bio: |
  Alejandro is passionate about using and teaching functional 
  programming -- especially Haskell -- and lightweight formal methods. 
  In an earlier life he worked as a junior associate professor at 
  Utrecht University, where he also received a PhD on the topic of 
  giving libraries the ability to customize the type errors produced 
  by the compiler (think Haskell's 'CustomError' on steroids.)

  Alejandro enjoys talking and promoting these topics. He's written 
  three books on the topic (“Practical Haskell”, “The Book of Monads”,
  and “Haskell (Almost) Standard Libraries”), is one of the hosts
  of the “Haskell Interlude” podcast, and is an avid presenter in 
  meetups and conferences.

  In his free time he enjoys playing board games (his perfect afternoon
  is one playing Carcassonne with friends), having a walk in the many 
  forests around the city of Utrecht, or simply sitting down and reading.
