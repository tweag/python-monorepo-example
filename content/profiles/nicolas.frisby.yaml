shortDescription: |
  Nick is a software architect dedicated to assuring correctness by discovering
  and encoding the most useful domain abstractions. He enjoys close cooperation
  with experts to enable and support the re-expression of their knowledge as
  semi-formal, formal, and even executable specifications.
bio: |
  His most trusty tool has been Haskell. Other interests include consensus
  building, tutorial writing, knowledge sharing presentations, professional
  development, all kinds of games, speculative fiction, dogs, hiking, and
  culinary adventures!

  At Tweag, Nick is known as a really strong and experienced Haskell engineer.
  He's very good in translating research into actual software and can dive into
  deep theoretical subjects to make his everyday code as correct as possible.
