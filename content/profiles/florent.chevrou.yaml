bio: |
  "Florent has a background in system modeling and verification with TLA+ and Event-B: he worked on the formal modeling and study of asynchronous communication models (message ordering policies) in his Ph.D. thesis. He then worked at CEA on a prototype engine to check that logs of personal data processing comply with the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Among many parallel interests, he has grown a special liking for functional programming. He practiced some OCaml during his years in academia and then got hooked into Haskell in his personal time: following online classes, programming challenges, and small personal projects. He looks forward to developing these skills professionally, among other Tweagers! He is also into teaching and scientific popularization."
