shortDescription: |
  Théophane is a Software Engineer and self-proclaimed Nix guru. He lives in a
  small house surrounded by awesome castles in the Loire Valley. When he’s not
  taking care of his four sons or playing some music, you might find him
  working.
bio: |
  Théophane doesn’t remember when he first started programming, but he
  apparently didn’t stop.

  After a MSc at École Polytechnique and a MSc in Computer Science from the
  MPRI, he began his professional career as an Tweag intern working on adding a
  type-system for Nix. He then decided to settle here, and has since been
  working on different projects, but always coming back to his one (second)
  true love Nix.

  He spends the rest of his time with his wife and kids, and the rest of the
  rest of his time playing the organ or conducting a local choir (or fighting
  bureaucratic daemons to get a small vocal music company going).

  At Tweag, Théophane is known to work on the most daunting challenges in the
  Nix world, such as the implementation of a content-addressable store,
  and to spread great attitude and good mood where he works.
