bio: |
  Nicolas is a Software Engineer who works on design, implementation
  and maintenance of micro-services. Before joining Tweag, he worked
  in academia, where he studied automata of many sorts (be they cellular,
  graph-, or tree-). Nicolas enjoys his automata, as they define notions
  of computation globally, rather than with a moving code pointer (so uncivilised!).
  He has a PhD and a MSc in computer science, from Université de Caen Normandie

  Away from the office, Nicolas is often seen playing {role playing, video, board}-games,
  reading or (tentatively) writing fiction, or playing with his cats.
