shortDescription: |
  Xavier is a generalist software engineer with a background in data science.
  He's worked on data processing pipelines, deep learning, signal processing,
  and REST services.  He enjoys taking time to write good, maintainable code,
  and constantly seeks to better his skills as a developer, as well as share
  what he learnt with others.  His quest for thoughtful coding and
  well-designed software is what lead him to Rust and functional programming.

bio: |
  Xavier worked a couple of years as a data scientist, but eventually realized
  that his main interest is writing software.  He briefly transitioned into a
  backend engineer role at the same company, before leaving to find a position
  that suit him better, here at Tweag.

  Software-wise, Xavier's passion revolves around Rust, but he's also well
  versed in Python, C, and is becoming familiar with Haskell and Elm.  He's
  also interested in teaching programming, as well as making programming more
  accessible to the end-users.  His hope is that advances in PLT and HCI will
  empower people to write more and better software, as well as make his own
  job more fun and embodied.

  In his spare time, Xavier likes to write and produce music, do yoga, and
  make all sorts of programming projects, mainly in Rust.  He also enjoys
  playing (video) games, listening to podcasts, and learning new skills.
