abstract: >
  A number of domain specific languages, such as circuits or
  data-science workflows, are best expressed as diagrams of boxes
  connected by wires. Unfortunately, functional languages have
  traditionally been ill-equipped to embed this sort of languages. The
  Arrow abstraction is an approximation, but we argue that it does not
  capture the right properties.

  A faithful abstraction is Symmetric Monoidal Categories (SMCs),
  but,so far,it hasn't been convenient to use. We show how the advent
  of linear typing in Haskell lets us bridge this gap. We provide a
  library which lets us program in SMCs with linear functions instead
  of SMC combinators. This considerably lowers the syntactic overhead
  of the EDSL to be on par with that of monadic DSLs. A remarkable
  feature of our library is that, contrary to previously known methods
  for categories, it does not use any metaprogramming.
