bio: |
  I'm a software engineer that grew up in trading, writing C++ with a Haskell accent.
  Such approach made my customers (business side) happy and my colleagues (who prefer mutating objects) puzzled.

  Now at Tweag, I'm looking forward to writing Haskell while drawing inspiration from my C++ background
  and being surrounded with like-minded people.
