shortDescription: |
  Krzysztof is a software engineer and a regular contributor to GHC since 2013.
  He enjoys many areas of theoretical computer science - algorithms,
  computational complexity, compilers, category theory etc.
bio: |
  Krzysztof is interested in implementation and application of techniques
  such as dependent types, linear types, modal logic, parametericity, automatic
  differentiation, program transformations. He likes to press for fast feedback
  loops and advertises NixOS. Krzysztof runs, learns foreign languages and
  reads non- and science fiction.

  Tweagers describe Krzysztof as brilliant and pragmatic mind, known for
  hilarious and mad debugging runs. If you work with Krzysztof you can expect a
  fun session full of life wisdom, mathematics, jokes, and piercingly
  accurate questions that get to the heart of a problem in no time.

      - I am working on linear types to GHC - the first version released in
        GHC 9.0. This involved large-scale merging work and accounting for many
        interactions of linear types with existing features in the compiler -
        data constructors, Template Haskell, Core and so on.
      - I am working with Zeus Logics on automatisation of supply chains.
        The project uses Haskell, TypeScript and Nix. This includes collection
        of documents from freight forwarders, tracking location of containers,
        submission of declarations to US Customs.

      - Codility is a recruitment tool. Programmers applying for a job
        are asked to solve a simple problem that is later automatically graded.
        I worked in depth on essentially every subsystem in Codility -
        Django frontend, assessment engine, customer invoice statistics,
        new algorithmic tasks, integrations with external services,
        database migrations, deployment scripts, build system etc.
        I introduced new types of user accounts, everyday production deployments,
        participated in firefighting many times and more. Over 6000 commits in total.
