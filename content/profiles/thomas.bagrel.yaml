shortDescription: |
  Thomas is a CS engineer, and (future) doctoral student working on linear types. He applies functional programming principles to build reliable and maintainable software wherever it's possible, but can also jump back to imperative programming languages when the situation requires it. He also works on Ormolu, a very popular Haskell formatter.
bio: |
  Thomas started with functional programming in 2017, during his CPGE cursus, with the Caml Light language. Won over by this way of building both reliable and composable software, Thomas then evolved on Scala, Rust, and eventually Haskell, which he's using currently at Tweag. Desiring to deepen his knowledge on type systems, Thomas will start a doctoral thesis on linear types in early 2022, under the supervision of A. Spiwack.

  Thomas currently lives in the east of France, near Nancy, where he completed his engineer school. In his free time, he practices climbing a lot, but also spends time studying classical menswear and playing video games.
