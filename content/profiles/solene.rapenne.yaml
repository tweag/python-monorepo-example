bio: |
  Solène got hooked into computer science when she tried a Slackware
  Linux installation CD-ROM from a magazine in early 2000s.

  After spending a few years on Linux learning by trials and errors, in
  2007 she went to the University to follow a three years course of study
  in computer science where she learned development theory and practice.

  Her first position started as a system administrator but evolved
  into a site reliability engineer. This was at a French company
  gathering real-time traffic information and broadcasting results to
  cars all over France. Meanwhile, she joined the open source project
  OpenBSD, a free operating system with a strong emphasis on security
  where software such as OpenSSH or LibreSSL are developed.

  In quest of new challenges, she joined the research and development
  team in a security oriented hosting company where she has brought many
  ideas while learning about the new context.

  Finally, Solène joined Tweag to exchange knowledge with other Tweagers,
  attracted by Tweag strong focus on open source and functional software.
