shortDescription: |
  Arnaud is Tweag's head of R&D. He described himself as a multi-classed
  Software Engineer/Constructive Mathematician. He can regularly be seen in the
  Paris office, but he doesn't live in Paris as he much prefers the calm and
  fresh air of his suburban town.
bio: |
  Arnaud's career before Tweag was that of a researcher in formal methods and
  programming language theory. He firmly believes that we don't know how to
  write good software yet. In this context, he compares software to bridges a
  lot; to chairs, as well.

  Outside of programming and computer science, Arnaud's pastimes include
  solving Rubik's cubes and speedrunning video games. Neither activity he is
  pretty good at; nevertheless you can find him on his Twitch channel, where he
  streams his speedrunning, as well as live coding sessions. He can also be
  found on Twitter where, perhaps unsurprisingly, he does neither, but thinks
  aloud about science.

  Tweager's know that Arnaud always has a good anecdote ready for any situation
  (sometimes also a good rant). Besides being an accomplished researcher, he is
  highly valued as pragmatic engineer and a curious, passionate and kind person
  who brings the "savoir-vivre" to computer sciences. Arnaud is also Tweag's
  first-address for anyone wanting to learn to program better with types.
