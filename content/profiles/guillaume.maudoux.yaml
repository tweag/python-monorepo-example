shortDescription: |
  Guillaume has a background in computer science, engineering and applied mathematics.
  Regarding software systems, his main concern is correctness, reliability, and trustworthiness.
  He is passionate about understanding complex systems and untangling intricate issues.

bio: |
  In academia, Guillaume built a solid knowledge of build systems, with a focus
  on understanding their peculiarities and what motivated their authors to
  start umpteenth implementation.  He still hopes to find a way to combine
  great ideas and make implementations converge to interoperable standards.

  His curiosity brought him through various other fields like formal methods
  and human-computer interactions in a first attempt at a PhD, and a large,
  eclectic set of taught courses amongst which numerical methods, databases,
  programming languages concepts and software engineering.
  There, he discovered a fondness for explaining concepts and sharing ideas.

  Guillaume is a long-time Nix enthusiast and member of its community. He
  also enjoys fixing tricky bugs in the software he uses, with a record of
  patches in various open-source projects. He likes to say that he prefers
  reading code than writing it.

  In his spare time, between taking care of two children, Guillaume likes to go
  cycling while listening to eclectic podcasts.  He also like playing indie
  video games, including Factorio as the game tugs at his heartstrings for build
  systems.
