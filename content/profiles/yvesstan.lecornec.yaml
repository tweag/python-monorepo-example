shortDescription: |
  Yves-Stan is a Software Engineer and is especially interested in
  static analysis, modern programming languages, and others automatic
  techniques and tooling that foster writing correct code.
  He is currently living in Nantes, France.
bio: |
  Yves-Stan is currently working on rules_haskell, the Bazel rules for
  compiling Haskell projects.

  Before this, he was part of the OCaml team at Mina Foundation contributing to the blockchain.

  Prior to joining the Tweag team, he worked as INRIA research
  engineer at the Paris ENS, doing static analysis of C code by
  abstract interpretation.

  Prior to that he had a postdoctoral position at the Lyon ENS,
  working on a web application designed to build models of biological
  systems.

  His PhD at the university of Evry related to model checking,
  developing methods to analyse modular systems using hierarchical
  abstractions.
