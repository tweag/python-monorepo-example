shortDescription: |
  Andreas is a physicist turned software engineer. He leads the Bazel team, and
  maintains Tweag's open source Bazel rule sets and the capability package. He
  is passionate about functional programming, and hermetic and reproducible
  builds. He lives in Zurich and is active in the local Haskell community.
bio: |
  Andreas studied physics at ETH Zurich and specialized on computational
  physics for his PhD at University of Fribourg on strongly correlated
  materials in non-equilibrium.

  While computational physics is heavy on C++, Fortan, and Python, it was this
  time where he found his passion for Haskell and Nix. Software has been a
  strong interest for Andreas from early on and after his time in academia he
  decided to work in the industry as a software engineer.

  At Tweag Andreas has worked as a software engineer on various projects
  involving Haskell, Scala, Nix, Bazel, and more. He now leads the Bazel team
  and maintains several of Tweag's open source projects including its Bazel
  rule sets.

  Outside of work Andreas contributes to the Haskell community in Zurich, right
  now as the president of the Zurich Friends of Haskell which organizes
  ZuriHac. He enjoys learning about programming languages, travelling, hiking,
  and spending time with his family.
