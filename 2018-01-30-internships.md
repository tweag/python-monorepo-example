Tweag I/O is inviting applications from students for our paid internship
programme this summer. If you're a student excited about working with Haskell,
nix and similar things, then get in touch!

In previous years, our interns have worked on a variety of projects across
research and engineering:

- Adding a [type system](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-05-23-typing-nix.html)
  to the `nix` language.
- Creating a new low-level [network backend](https://github.com/tweag/swarm) for
  Haskell.
- Creating a library for distributed FRP (functional reactive programming).
- Creating a library for linearly typed streaming.

We have a few ideas for projects which you might want to work on (see the bottom
of this post for details), or feel free to propose one of your own. We're happy
to consider projects which might form part of a dissertation, either as a summer
project or over a longer term.

Internships would most likely be on a remote basis, though if you're local to
Paris then we could also host you at our Paris office. If you're in one of the
countries where we have a strong presence then we would also try to arrange
reguar meetings with advisors at a mutually convenient location.

Here are some potential project ideas:

- Writing a type system for directory trees for use in
  [funflow](https://github.com/tweag/funflow).
- Writing a monadic streaming JSON parser.
- Write a 'nix' library to produce per-module nix derivations for Haskell
  projects.
- Contribute to fixing bugs in GHC related to static pointers.
- Contribute to fixing bugs in GHC related to inline-java.
- Writing a webapp which allows graphical composition of Funflow workflows.

To apply, or to ask for more information or to discuss an idea for a project
you'd like to consider working on, drop us an email with a brief r√©sume at
jobs@tweag.io.
