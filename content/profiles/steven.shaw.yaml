shortDescription: |
  Steven is a software engineer who likes to write simple, reliable code and
  loves programming languages.

bio: |
  He has 30 years of hands-on industry experience across many domains,
  including telecommunications and finance. He likes to apply functional
  programming to create reliable, maintainable software.

  He's currently working with Haskell and likes other contemporary languages
  such as Rust, OCaml, Elm, and PureScript. He has high hopes that we will
  see widespread industry adoption of programming languages with
  full-spectrum dependent types.

  He started programming at 11, mostly building computer games on a
  Commodore 64. He's always been curious about how things work â€” to
  demystify the magic. Much of his love of programming languages is
  explained by his desire to understand how they are implemented.

  Even though he likes fancy enlightened programming languages, he
  doesn't mind a low-brow solution such as a Bash script when it makes
  sense.

  He comes with healthy doses of enthusiasm, openness, humour, and common
  sense.
