bio: |
  Amyas self-identifies as a philosopher and has half a career as an academic,
  specialising in early modern philosophy and the philosophy of language. He
  also has half a career as a freelance/contract web developer, with expertise
  in several aspects of the JavaScript eco-system, and a growing preference for
  strict typing and functional programming. Whenever possible he likes to
  combine these two halves, by developing digital tools and web sites to aid in
  philosophical research.
