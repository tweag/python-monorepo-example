shortDescription: |
  Yann is working at Tweag on the Nickel programming language, a
  next-generation configuration language to manage the growing
  complexity of Infrastructure-as-Code and a candidate successor for the
  language Nix.
bio: |
  In his career, Yann worked as a freelance fullstack developer for some time,
  developing internal web platforms for various clients. He received his PhD
  in Computer Science from IRIF (Université Paris Diderot) where he worked on
  the compilation of a shared-memory concurrent language into Linear Logic.

  His technical interests include functional programming, programming languages
  design, type theory and logic. He has also now dived in the wonderful world of
  Nix and DevOps in general. Outside of work, Yann loves hiking, reading,
  bouldering, cooking, petting dogs and drinking green tea.
