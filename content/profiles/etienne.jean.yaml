  Etienne is a data engineer at Tweag, with a bioinformatics background. As part of the data team at Tweag,
  he acts on data engineering projects, both internal to Tweag and for clients in the pharmaceutical industry.
  He lives in Paris, and is regularly in Tweag's Paris office, enjoying the direct view onto the train
  station's 1901 "clock tower".
bio: |
  Etienne started his higher education with mathematics, physics and aeronautical engineering, before switching 
  to biology and finally specializing in bioinformatics. Before joining Tweag, he worked as an engineer in academic 
  research, where he developed data pipelines and models for the study of DNA replication. Since then, he has 
  continued to slowly evolve towards the data engineering world with the motivation to write better software.

  Etienne has experience with several technologies, like the R and Python ecosystems for data science, 
  the workflow-specific language Nextflow, and the Google cloud products for data engineering. He also nourishes 
  interests in the programming languages Haskell and Rust.
