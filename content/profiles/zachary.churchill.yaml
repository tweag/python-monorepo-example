bio: |
  Zach began working in software interning at a network security company
  on recommendation from some colleagues when trying to turn their hobby
  of programming into a career during university. After a few months of
  hard work, dedication, and mentoring from coworkers and CLC members,
  this turned into a senior level position where the bulk of their
  computer science and engineering education developed. They spent the
  first year working for 8 hours, and then going home and studying for 
  8 hours, grinding as much as possible to become an effective software
  developer as quickly as possible. During this period of education and
  growth, Tweag was a household name in the Haskell community for all of
  its work in open source, its blog posts, its sponsorships. Tweag was
  always a goal in the back of their mind. They continued gaining
  experience for 4 years until finally reaching their goal of working
  at Tweag. Their experience ranges from network security, IT training,
  web services, networking, blockchain, and some devops.
