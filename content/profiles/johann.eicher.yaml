shortDescription: |
  Johann is an engineer based in Cape Town, South Africa. With an academic
  background in the life sciences, over the years he has moved into software
  engineering. He enjoys the functional programming paradigm, and applying
  tried-and-tested engineering principles to real-world problems.
bio: |
  Johann obtained his Ph.D. in Biochemistry, which focussed on constructing
  dynamic models of metabolism in bacteria. During this time he worked on
  building a software package to process quantitative nuclear magnetic
  resonance spectroscopy data. This marked the beginning of a new career
  direction in software engineering.

  Johann has since worked in a number of academic and commercial contexts as a
  software engineer – most recently for a genomics startup. While the life
  sciences are dominated by languages like Python – which favour the imperative
  mode – it was in this context that he discovered the power of functional
  programming, and specifically, Haskell's purity and strong type system for
  developing maintainable and readable code.

  Johann enjoys spending his leisure time reading, converting his garden into a
  more indigenous green space, exercising his two greyhounds, and surfing the
  many beautiful beaches of Cape Town.
