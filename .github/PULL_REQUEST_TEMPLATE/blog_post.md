New blog post

### Phase 0: Self-review

- Content
  - [ ] I have read ["Blog - Setting clear expectations"](https://github.com/tweag/meta/blob/master/handbook/blog.md#setting-clear-expectations) from the handbook

  - [ ] Checked that title makes clear what is achieved in the end
  - [ ] Checked that introduction lays out the "How" and the "What", as well as the target audience
  - [ ] Checked that conclusion recalls "What" was achieved, and the qualities of the "How" compared to alternatives

- Spelling
  - [ ] Check spelling
  - [ ] Check [`codespell`](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) suggestions
        (`$ codespell --write-changes --interactive=3 post.md`)
- Render
  - [ ] Made sure all the links work
  - [ ] Checked that footnotes are properly rendered

### Phase 1: Technical Review

- [ ] Asked relevant people for a review on the technical content
- [ ] Gathered and applied technical reviews

### Phase 2: Editorial review

- [ ] Notified Juan (@guaraqe) to get an editorial review

Next phases will be checked by the editorial team.
