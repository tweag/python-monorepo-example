shortDescription: |
  Jonathon leads the Sales team at Tweag. His team is charged with finding
  projects which fit the Tweag mission to help the industry build better
  software through improving developer and scientist experience; whether that
  be through better languages, processes or tooling. Jonathon is passionate
  about working on great projects with great people - something that he gets to
  do each day with Tweag and our clients.
bio: |
  Prior to joining Tweag, he worked for over ten years at several high growth
  custom software development providers and technology consultancies; 
  building, training, motivating and leading high performance sales teams.  His
  career led him to become an experienced sales director who has worked across a
  wide range of projects and work cultures. This experience is immensely useful
  in his current position to understand what Tweag's clients need and how it
  can be done effectively.

  Before starting his career, Jonathon studied Politics and Economics at the
  University of East Anglia, UK. Post graduation he has committed himself to
  extensive sales theory research.  Away from the office, Jonathon enjoys
  living in London with his wife and young son, travelling, and drinking
  interesting wine and great coffee - so much so he's helped to create two
  coffee brands.

  Other Tweagers enjoy Jonathon's openness and kindness, his very contagious
  smile, but most of all his ability to focus discussions on the essential, 
  his skill to build consensus around difficult decisions with simplicity, 
  and his capacity to provide a highly technical, need-driven and
  personalized sales approach for Tweag's client.
