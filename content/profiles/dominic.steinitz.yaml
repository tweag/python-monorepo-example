bio: |
  Dominic is an Applied Mathematician and statistician specializing in Haskell.
  Since joining Tweag, he has worked on modelling physiological systems using the differential equation solving suite SUNDIALS, and enhancing the shopping experience using Hidden Markov Models.
  Dominic is vastly experienced and, prior to his time with Tweag, held roles in physiological/pharmacological modelling, qualitative analytics, computer security, economics forecasting, and medical statistics across the airline, banking, and pharmaceutical industries.
  He has an M.A. in Maths and a Diploma in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Cambridge, and a PhD in Computer Science from Kingston University.
  Away from work, Dominic plays the fiddle in ceilidh band and local orchestra, cycles, and maintains quite a few Haskell libraries.

        Over 4 years experience in exotic equity derivatives working
        closely with traders in the front office developing pricing
        models using Stochastic Calculus, Monte Carlo and Partial
        Differential Equations.

        Developed an EDSL (embedded domain specific language) to express
        exotic financial options, price them, display them in user
        friendly way and analyse them through their lifecycle. Trades
        that once took months to develop can now be written in hours.

        - Priced exotic options via Monte Carlo and partial differential equations

        - Improved the handling of systematic trading strategies using
          techniques such as fold / map fusion.

        - Improved/refactored the compilation of the EDSL into
          mathematical notation (in pdf format) to optimise expressions
          and improve readability

        - Wrote tools to collect and analyse usage data (about
          1GB/month) to identify and retire redundant trades

        - Improved support in the EDSL for overhedging to handle discontinuities in exotic options

        - Added support for settlement dates in the compilation of the
          EDSL into C; the C can then be run to give prices.

        - Implemented a language enhancement to allow one trade to be
          expressed in terms of others.

        - Managed the global release of a new version of the EDSL

        Delivered many security projects including a two factor
        authentication (2FA) and transaction signature for Retail
        Internet Banking for millions of customers using a triple DES key
        on the debit card chip which was acceptable to customers and was
        highly effective against the then new internet frauds that were
        causing problems for other banks.

        Determined group-wide IT security challenges, and managed a team
        to set/deliver security strategy for the global group via a set
        of group-wide security programmes.  These provided better
        security (done once rigorously and re-used many times), faster
        time to market, lower costs and an enhanced customer/user
        experience, and won a number of awards.

        Key projects included:

        - Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for Retail Internet
           Banking. Defined and delivered an innovative, effective and
           efficient mechanism for Internet Banking which was acceptable
           to customers and was effective against the then-new internet
           frauds that were causing problems for other banks.

        - Core Web Security. Defined and delivered a £5m programme to
          implement common logical access for 19 projects in a
          Group-wide programme which secured 40+applications with
          100,000+ users. It was the single biggest change to RBS' IT
          infrastructure in 15 years and won a British Computer Society
          award in 2007.

        - Systems Access. Developed/delivered a programme to address
          systemic weaknesses in controlling access for 100,000 users
          and 500 high risk systems.  Won the Financial Services
          Technology Award 2008 for “the security strategy of the year”
          and a European Identity Award in 2008.

        - Two Factor Authentication for Corporate Banking: Developed a
          new cost-effective method for securing corporate customer
          transactions using a smart card and a hand held reader which
          reduced costs from £40/user to £5-10.
