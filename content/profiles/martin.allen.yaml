bio: |

  Martin started programming as a Haskell engineer in 2015 and has since worked in
  a variety of settings, including web development, blockchain engineering,
  numerical analysis, and event-driven systems. He has extensive experience 
  in the Blockchain space, and has been working at several levels in this industry since 2016.
  He also has a passion for open source software and has contributed to or led on much of 
  Haskell and PureScript tooling around Ethereum. 
  
  Prior to programming he was pursuing a PhD in Mathematics in the field of Algebraic
  Geometry. As a software developer, this has transformed into an interest in the use 
  of various methods to prove program correctness.
  
  Martin enjoys endurance sports and is an avid trail runner, cyclist, and skier. 
  Outside of work, you can find him in the mountains in his home state of
