  Mathieu is an engineer and researcher from France, with skills ranging from
  model driven engineering to formal methods and Agda. He has a deep interest
  in functional programming and dependently typed languages.
bio: |
  Mathieu is an engineer and researcher, interested in functional programming
  and dependently typed languages. He studied computer sciences and applied
  mathematics in Toulouse, after which he obtained a PhD on a topic combining
  separations of concerns, behavioral semantics and formal methods. During this
  process he discovered, and fell in love, with Agda. And how could he not?
  Doesn't Agda combine a dependently typed system with a purely functional
  Haskell-y way of programming? Mathieu hopes that one day reliable and scalable
  software could be effectively written in Agda, a goal that seems so close, yet
  so far.

  While Mathieu has always worked behind a computer screen, he compensates for
  this lack of sun exposure with a variety of outdoor activities, from
  occasional hikes to regular bike rides in the hilly landscapes of France. He
  can also be found online enjoying a chess game with friends or complete
  strangers, a hobby almost as old as his coding addiction. In addition, Mathieu
  is always eager to have a chat about other's hobbies, as he feels that talking
  with somebody passionate about a specific topic is the best way to learn and
  get a feeling about it. These discussions can last for a while, especially if
  you start mentioning to him the conceptual revolutions that arose in
  theoretical physics at the beginning of the 20th century.
