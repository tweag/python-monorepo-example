shortDescription: |
  Claudio is a software engineer with a passion for functional programming,
  striving for correctness and elegance.
bio: |
  He started with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science but after that
  diverged to working in the security industry, analyzing Malware samples in an
  automatic fashion and putting anti-malware software to the test.

  His experience includes a diverse set of frameworks and languages, ranging
  from Common Lisp to LabVIEW and more common languages including Scala and
  Python.

  He began using NixOS in 2018 and started contributing to its tooling soon
  thereafter in true open-source itch-scratching spirit.

  Meanwhile, his former job led him to recognize the value of reproducible
  builds and this triggered interest in Bazel as well.

  When not working, he likes spending time with his family and friends, playing
  table tennis with his kids and heading out on (preferably smooth) water for
  rowing.
