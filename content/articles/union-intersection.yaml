abstract: >
  Union and intersection types are a staple of gradually typed
  language such as TypeScript. While it's long been recognized that
  union and intersection types are difficult to verify statically, it
  may appear at first that the dynamic part of gradual typing is
  actually pretty simple.

  It turns out however, that in presence of higher-order contracts
  union and intersection are deceptively difficult. The literature on
  higher-order contracts with union and intersection, while keenly
  aware of the fact, doesn't really explain why. We point and
  illustrate the problems and trade-offs inherent to union and
  intersection contracts, via example and a survey of the literature.
