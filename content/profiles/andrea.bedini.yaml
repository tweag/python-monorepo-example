shortDescription: |
  Andrea is a researcher and software engineer driven by the passion to
  solve problems in a better way.

  Before joining Tweag, Andrea has been a researcher, lecturer, software
  engineer and data scientist.

  He believes in empowering people and loves to find (or create) the
  right tool for the right job for the right person.

bio: |
  Andrea's interests lie at the intersection between physics, mathematics
  and computer science. He has a PhD in Physics and years of research
  experience across statistical mechanics, combinatorics, bioinformatics
  and traffic modelling.

  He first learnt to program on the Commodore 64 at the age of 10 and,
  since then, he has always been curious about how to express his ideas to
  a computer.

  In industry, Andrea has worked in various roles such as data scientist,
  software engineer and solution architect. He still loves to pile-up
  research papers on his desk.

  Andrea believes in empowering people and supports communities that
  promote skills sharing, digital literacy and collaboration. He
  participates in the Perth Functional Programmers meetup.
