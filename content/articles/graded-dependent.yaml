  Graded Type Theory provides a mechanism to track and reason about resource
  usage in type systems. In this paper, we develop GraD, a novel version of
  such a graded dependent type system that includes functions, tensor
  products, additive sums, and a unit type. Since standard operational
  semantics is resource-agnostic, we develop a heap-based operational
  semantics and prove a soundness theorem that shows correct accounting of
  resource usage. Several useful properties, including the standard type
  soundness theorem, non-interference of irrelevant resources in computation
  and single pointer property for linear resources, can be derived from this
  theorem. We hope that our work will provide a base for integrating
  linearity, irrelevance and dependent types in practical programming
  languages like Haskell.
