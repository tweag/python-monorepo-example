shortDescription: |
  Mathieu is an engineer and doctor from France, with skills ranging
  from model driven engineering to functional programming and formal
  methods. Mathieu leads the High Assurance Software team.
bio: |
  Mathieu is an engineer and doctor, interested in functional
  programming and dependently typed languages. He studied computer
  sciences and applied mathematics in Toulouse, and conducted his PhD
  on a topic combining software engineering (through separations of
  concerns), safety properties (through behavioural semantics) and
  formal methods (using Agda).

  Mathieu is interested in dependently typed languages in general and
  Agda in particular. He hopes that one day reliable and scalable
  software can be efficiently developed using this language.

  Outside of work, Mathieu can likely be found riding the hilly
  landscapes of France on his bicycle or motorcycle, online enjoying
  some chess games, or at a violin rehearsal.
