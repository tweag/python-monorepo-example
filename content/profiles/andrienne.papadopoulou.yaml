shortDescription: |
  Andrienne is part of the operations at Tweag. You will most likely catch her
  working on an excel spreadsheet at any given day.
bio: |
  She specialized in Finance during her time in the university, but once she
  completed her studies, she chose to move in a different direction working as
  a project manager in the field of clinical research in the UK as she wanted
  to work in an environment where she could recognize how her work is
  contributing to something bigger. Following a 10-year absence from her
  homeland she returned only when conditions felt right and started working for
  Tweag, where she felt she could still contribute with her own organizational
  and analytical skills to a place that in its own rightful way is contributing
  to developing great ideas.

  Andrienne won't let anyone down and fights paper and numbers to keep Tweag
  running smoothly, while being appreciated as open, approachable and great
  person to have around.
