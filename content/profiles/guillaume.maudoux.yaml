bio: |
  Guillaume has a background in computer science, engineering and applied mathematics.
  Concerning software systems, his main concern is correctness, reliability, and trustworthiness.
  He is passionate about understanding complex systems and untangling intricate issues.

  In academia, Guillaume built a solid knowledge of build systems and formal methods.
  There, he also got fond of teaching and sharing ideas.

  In his spare time, Guillaume likes to go cycling (while listening to eclectic podcasts)
  and playing indie video games (like factorio, the ultimate build system).
