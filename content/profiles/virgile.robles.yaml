shortDescription: |
  Virgile is a French native with a background in formal methods and OCaml. He
  loves everything functional and typed, but is also keenly interested in
  efficient, low-level (or plain obscure) programming.
bio: |
  Virgile studied theoretical and practical computer science (algorithms, type
  systems, program verification, ...) in Bordeaux, and is currently finishing up
  his PhD at CEA and CentraleSupélec.

  During his PhD, he developed an extension of ACSL — a specification language
  for C programs — to enable the specification of high-level requirements. He
  had the opportunity to apply these verification techniques to industrial-scale
  use cases.

  Already at high school Virgile began learning OCaml as a hobby and has been a
  committed OCaml user ever since, but he is very keen to learn more of Haskell.
  More broadly, his favorite topics include formal methods, type systems,
  compilers, and efficient algorithms. 

  Other than that, Virgile likes to create or play with obscure programming
  languages (check out Boblang on his Github) and other random things (e.g., he
  is currently trying to write a NES emulator in OCaml). In his free time he
  enjoys good video games, meals, walks, rocks to climb, piano sessions and
  nights out.
