shortDescription: |
  Chris is a recovering mathematician and software engineer at Tweag. He
  has spent much of his career working for academia, from both the
  business and the research sides of the industry. He perceives a
  universe where code and poetry exist in the same space, with all that
  entails.

bio: |
  Outside his significant steeping in STEM, Chris enjoys analogue
  pursuits (the more creative, the better), suffusion within the natural
  world and any opportunity to broaden his horizons. This has manifested
  itself in, amongst other things, reading, writing, cooking (he's a
  trained chocolatier), birding and road cycling.
