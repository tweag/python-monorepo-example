Our mission: deliver correct high-performance software faster. To do
that, we recruited a team of experimentalists who use their formal
training in a variety of theories and their experience to continuously
improve our methodology and publish new tech. Theories that are
represented in our team: theory of programming languages, natural
languages, operational and control theory, mathematics...

We have found functional programming in particular to be an enabling
factor for us on some of the most ambitious projects we've
faced: [breaking through the exascale barrier][sage] in HPC, storing
and analyzing vast amounts of clinical trial data, parsing logs at
scale, video search with natural language, building complex SaaS
products with thousands of concurrent users...

That's why over the past couple of years we've been active
contributors to [GHC][ghc]
(the
[-XStaticPointers extension][staticptr],
[extending][th-reify] [Template Haskell][addmodcstub],
[linear types][linear-types]...), sought to achieve seamless
reproducible builds for multi-language projects
(Stack's [Nix integration][stack-nix] and other contributions), broke
down the barriers between Haskell and other languages
([HaskellR][haskellr], [inline-java][inline-java]), scaled Haskell to
run concurrently on hundreds of machines ([sparkle][sparkle]) while
leveraging the existing Apache ecosystem, and built numerous other
tools and libraries for high-performance distributed programming.

Today we're looking to spread the reach of functional programming. Not
to preach to the choir - to boldly go where no functional programmer
has gone before. That's where you can help! If listening to customers
about the challenges they're facing, talking to them about your
experience using functional programming, sharing your success stories
and coding a bunch sounds like your idea of a good day, we have just
the role for you. We're looking to add a new member to our team in
a pretty unique role: a *technical evangelist*.

This is a senior developer role, but with a twist. You'll be getting
your hands dirty and fighting from the trenches like the rest of us,
building infrastructure for large scientific projects, creating tools
to make people's job easier and bring data to them faster. You'll be
listening and talking about it the rest of the time, within the
company, with our customers and the multiple developer communities out
there.

What we're looking for:

* Excellent oral and written communication skills in English.
* A passion for programming languages and a track record working with typed and untyped functional (Haskell, Scala, Clojure), system (Rust, C++, ...) or scientific (R, Python, Julia, ...) languages.
* Experience writing technical content or explaining technical concepts in blog posts, forums, emails, or other channels.
* A willingness to travel, engage with the community and speak at conferences.

We're a European company, with an international presence. This role is
remote work compatible, but we'll be prioritizing candidates that are
able to relocate anywere in Europe, or better yet at our headquarters
here in Paris.
