The problem
 * Deploy dynamically linked executables or libraries.

One can choose to deliver statically linked executables
or docker containers, but ...

Motivation
 * JVM can link shared libraries or PIEs only.
   * Introduce briefly spark and how it launches distributed applications.
   * Explain that we want to produced self-contained jars.
 * Compilers usually link dynamically by default. So closures of
   libraries allow to trade the trouble of making full static
   programs ?

Explain clodl usage.

Explain the library wrapper/linking trick.

Explain briefly why bazel in our case. But the solution can be
used in other settings.
