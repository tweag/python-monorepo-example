shortDescription: |
  Bryan is a Software Engineer at Tweag focussed on Developer
  Productivity and automation. Passionate about good quality software,
  and of the belief that you shouldn't stop learning until nature
  forces you to do so.
bio: |
  Bryan has touched a few areas of the field already. Ranging from
  embedded systems to full blown cloud platforms, but was always left
  unsatisfied with the quality, and lack of automation. These days he
  spends his time trying to get people to write better code, and teach
  them about making their own work irrelevant, through automation.
  When he's not playing guitar that is. Whilst also trying to keep up
  with all the new cool toys being released in functional programming
  land.
