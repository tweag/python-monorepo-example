shortDescription: |
  David is a senior engineer, deeply invested into infrastructure and automation.
  A meister at deploying software into highly available and scalable production environments.

bio: |
  As an engineer, David views technologies as a means to achieve goals and not as an end.
  Started with mainframes, proprietary software & virtualization, then moved on to
  cloud computing, open-source, and containerization. He is a disciple of the KISS principle and
  balances his love for trying out new technologies with tried-and-true solutions to build
  reliable and scalable architectures.

  When David is not debugging production incidents, he might be climbing or wakeboarding
  as he enjoys not only a good old terminal, but also new heights and waves.
