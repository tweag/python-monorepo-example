shortDescription: |
  Gabriel would like to see a future where any developer would enthusiastically
  use formal methods to produce safe code. When he's not thinking about that
  future, Gabriel likes to play the flute or the guitar, listen to anything
  between jazz and progressive rock, do gardening or drink tea.
bio: |
  Gabriel started learning functional programming along with artificial
  intelligence in the French Civil Aviation university. There, he discovered
  that programming languages could be more than a mere list of instructions.
  To more thoroughly understand programming languages, and do more with them,
  he decided to follow the path of formal methods.
  In that context, Gabriel worked to improve interoperability between proof
  assistants during his PhD at ENS Paris-Saclay. More specifically his PhD
  targeted the Prototype Verification System (commonly abbreviated PVS).
