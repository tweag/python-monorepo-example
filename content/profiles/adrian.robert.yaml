bio: |
  Adrian hails originally from academia but left after a PhD to get hands-on
  with software in advanced visualization and informatics. But technological
  foundations were lacking and as efforts towards a brave new semantic web
  fizzled out, he focused increasingly on the drive towards seamless
  computation: cloud and DevOps. After having fallen in love with Scala he
  believes functional programming paradigms will play in an increasing role in
  these major trends.

  Outside the office, he enjoys the outdoors on foot or two wheels (motorized
  or not) and also plays with novel user interface ideas on his computer.
