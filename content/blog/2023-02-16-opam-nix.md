[opam] is a source-based package manager for [OCaml]. It is the de-facto
standard for package management in the OCaml ecosystem. [opam's main package
repository] contains over 4000 individual
packages, on average spanning 7 versions each.

Like many other language-specific package managers (e.g. cargo, cabal, etc.), opam
performs four main tasks:

1. Download the sources.
2. Resolve the needed dependencies of a package.
3. Provide those dependencies such that the build system can find them.
4. Run the build system.

It is pretty good at this. However, there are some problems with step (4):

- The build is not properly isolated: it can (in theory) fetch arbitrary things
  from the network, access arbitrary files on the filesystem, and even modify
  other packages. This allows for irreproducible builds, and makes it easy to
  forget to explicitly list a system dependency if it happens to be installed
  on the author's system.
- "External" (system) dependencies, such as non-OCaml binaries and libraries,
  are taken from the user's distribution repository (using the distribution's
  package manager, e.g. `apt-get`), resulting in version inconsistencies and
  the possibility for breakage.
- The builds are not easily cached and reused, meaning you have to compile
  packages locally.

Also, opam's user interface is based around imperative commands, meaning
that the developer environment setup has to be a script that modifies a _switch_
(opam's term for an independent collection of interdependent packages), which
is fragile, difficult to update, and prone to inconsistencies. While there are
[tools](https://github.com/tweag/check_opam_switch) that solve some of those
issues, this can still be painful.

Finally, opam is a package manager for OCaml. It can't easily integrate with
other programming languages. This is a problem for modern software stacks,
which often feature multiple programming languages in a single project.

# Introducing `opam-nix`

If you're familiar with Nix, you might have noticed that it doesn't have any
of the aforementioned problems. However, Nix on its own doesn't know how to
build opam packages. The solution to this? Make a library that "translates" opam
packages into a format which Nix can understand. That's exactly what [`opam-nix`][opam-nix] is!

`opam-nix` provides low-level functions which parse [opam files][opam file format] into Nix data structures (using [opam-file-format]), interpret those
data structures, resolve the dependency tree (using opam itself), and turn the
dependency tree into derivations. It also has some overrides which ensure that a
lot of popular packages build and function correctly.

If that sounds scary, don't worry, `opam-nix` also provides high-level tools
which make Nixifying your OCaml projects a breeze. In this blog post, we'll
show some examples of how to quickly Nixify your existing opam-based projects.
Whether you're working on improving the onboarding experience on a project or are an
OCaml developer yourself, we hope you'll find it useful.

In the following, we assume that you already [have Nix installed] and are using
[flakes]. Also, the templates are suited to building opam projects.

[opam-nix]: https://github.com/tweag/opam-nix
[opam file format]: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Manual.html#Common-file-format
[opam-file-format]: https://github.com/ocaml/opam-file-format
[flakes]: https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/
[have nix installed]: https://nixos.org/download.html

## Simple package

To get started, fetch the template provided with `opam-nix`. From your project's
root:

```console
$ nix flake init -t github:tweag/opam-nix
$ git add flake.nix
```

Nix will create a `flake.nix` for you. Note that you have to add it to the Git
index, otherwise Nix will not pick it up. Open it with your editor, look through
the file, and replace the `throw` with your package name, as specified in the
comment:

```diff
   outputs = { self, flake-utils, opam-nix, nixpkgs }@inputs:
-    # Don't forget to put the package name instead of `throw':
-    let package = throw "Put the package name here!";
+    let package = "my-package";
     in flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
```

Nix is famous for its "shells": ad-hoc, on-the-fly environments, allowing
developers to quickly get started on and switch between projects. `opam-nix`
allows you to leverage this potential to make onboarding to your projects quick
and easy.

Now run

```console
$ nix develop
```

Nix will download and lock opam-nix, nixpkgs, opam-repository,
and some other dependencies, then build all the dependencies of your project. Once
that's done, it will drop you into a shell with all the dependencies available.

Unfortunately, that won't always happen; `opam-nix` can't provide perfect
compatibility with opam. Most errors you will get are actually symptoms of
problematic packaging of your dependencies, e.g. missing a system dependency
requirement, arbitrary network access during the build, etc. The proper way to
fix such errors is to fix the packaging upstream. However, you can also just
override the dependency using the `overlay` in your `flake.nix`. You can read
more about [overlays] and [package overrides] if you are not familiar. For
example, you can change the commands used to build a package like this:

```diff
         overlay = final: prev:
           {
             # Your overrides go here
+            dune = prev.dune.overrideAttrs (_: { buildPhase = "make release"; });
           };
       in {
         legacyPackages = scope.overrideScope' overlay;
```

Additionally, if your project requires libraries or tools written in other
languages, you can [look for them in nixpkgs][nixpkgs-search] or package them
with Nix (maybe using other \*-nix tools). Once you have the package, you can
simply then inject it into `buildInputs` of your project using `overrideAttrs`
inside an `overlay`.

[nixpkgs-search]: https://search.nixos.org/packages
[overlays]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-overlays
[package overrides]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#chap-overrides

Once you get to the shell, you can use the usual tools to build your package.
Typically, that would be something like `dune build` or `make`. You can also use
[nixpkgs phases] to build and test your project using commands specified in the
opam file:

```console
$ eval "$prePatch"
$ eval "$configurePhase"
$ eval "$buildPhase"
$ eval "$checkPhase"
```

[nixpkgs phases]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-stdenv-phases

Note that this approach combines the benefits of Nix (reproducibility, reliable
caching, isolation) for your dependencies with the benefits of your build system
(fast, incremental builds, granular caching) for your project itself.

If you want to go all-in on Nix, you can build your project as a Nix derivation
too. Just run:

```console
$ nix build
```

This will build and check your project. You can find the build artifacts in the
`result` folder.

## Fully-featured development environment

Many developers are not content with simply being able to build the package,
though; they also want to have modern amenities such as a language server to get
interactive documentation, type information, and code navigation.

Worry not! `opam-nix` can also help with that. We'll use a different template
here, so make sure to back up any changes to `flake.nix` you might have made in
the previous section.

```console
$ mv flake.nix flake.nix.bkp
$ nix flake init -t github:tweag/opam-nix#multi-package
$ git add flake.nix
```

Replicate the overrides you made before, if any. You don't need to specify
the package name here, since this template picks up all packages in your
repository. It's also a good idea to look through `flake.nix`, as it might give
you ideas for improving your development experience.

You can now use

```console
nix develop
```

to get a development environment, as before.

However, now you also get `ocaml-lsp-server` and `ocamlformat` available. You
can add other OCaml tools to the `devPackagesQuery` as well. For your editor to
pick them up, you'll have to start it from this environment. Alternatively, since
this template provides an `.envrc`, you can use [direnv], which has integrations
with many popular editors.

[direnv]: https://direnv.net/

Note that for `ocaml-lsp` to work, it must be able to find type information for
your project. Typically, you can ensure this by running

```console
$ dune build @check
```

If you wish, you can also build your package with:

```console
$ nix build .#<your-package>
```

## Diving deeper

Since `opam-nix` is a Nix tool, you get a lot of advantages of Nix, like
reproducibility, [easy CI with binary caching][easy-ci] for even faster
developer onboarding, integration with [NixOS] to get reproducible system
deployments, or with [Docker] for compatibility with most of the world.

[easy-ci]: https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-07-08-buildkite-for-nix-ci/
[nixos]: https://nixos.org
[docker]: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-pkgs-dockerTools

Also, because `opam-nix` follows the philosophy of composing small, low-level
parts to make a bigger, user-friendly whole, you can make use of it
even if your project doesn't fit the requirements of `buildOpamProject`.

For [`dune-project`]-based projects, you can use [`buildDuneProject`] instead
of `buildOpamProject`.

[`dune-project`]: https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#dune-project-1
[`buildduneproject`]: https://github.com/tweag/opam-nix#buildduneproject

If you just have a single opam export, that's then imported with `opam import`.
This setup can be replicated with a snippet like this:

```nix
let
  # This is a list of package names installed in the switch
  switch = opam-nix.opamListToQuery (opam-nix.fromOPAM ./opam.export).installed;

  scope = with opam-nix;
    queryToScope { repos = [ opamRepository (makeOpamRepo ./.) ]; }
    (switch // { my-package = "dev"; });
in scope.my-package
```

Or, if you want to build a [Mirage unikernel](https://mirage.io/), you can
do so using [hillingar](https://github.com/RyanGibb/hillingar), an `opam-nix`-
based tool.

If you want to speed up your project by avoiding [Import From Derivation],
`opam-nix` [supports][materialization] `haskell.nix`-style materialization.

Also, if you're using [jupyenv's OCaml kernel][jupyenv-ocaml], you're actually
using `opam-nix` under the hood; this means all the tricks mentioned previously
can also work there

[jupyenv-ocaml]: https://jupyenv.io/documentation/options/#kernel-ocaml

You can check out the documentation for all the public functions provided by
`opam-nix` in [the README]. Let us know if you make something cool with this!

## Inspirations & alternatives

`opam-nix` wouldn't be possible without [opam] and [opam-file-format]. It uses
them directly and reimplements some parts of them in Nix.

The way `opam-nix` works is similar to [crate2nix], [cabal2nix], and
[poetry2nix]. Inspiration for many technical decisions was drawn from these
projects.

Finally, there are a couple of similar projects which serve a similar purpose
but achieve it slightly differently.

- [opam2nix] is the original in this space. However, it requires committing
  generated files into the repository, doesn't integrate well with Flakes, and
  is not as flexible.
- [opam-nix-integration] is quite similar to opam-nix. However, it's not
  as flexible since it doesn't allow to import opam switches or easily call
  multiple packages from the same workspace.

## Conclusion

`opam-nix` is a flexible yet user-friendly library to turn opam packages
into Nix derivations. It is already mature enough to be used by [dune], [ocaml-lsp],
and others, and yet there are still features and interface improvements
waiting to happen. We encourage you to try it on your project and share your
experience and feedback in the [issue tracker].
