We're hiring multiple software engineers to join our team.

Our mission: deliver correct high-performance software faster. We have
found functional programming in particular to be an enabling factor
for us on some of the most ambitious projects we've faced for our
clients: breaking through the [exascale barrier in HPC][sage],
modeling a large variety of physiological processes in the human body,
designing pipelines for [storing and analyzing][pfizer] biophysical
data, video search with natural language, building complex SaaS
products with thousands of concurrent users and many others.

## Who?

We are _pragmatists_. We use technologies such as [Nix][nix], Haskell,
C/++, R, Python in combination with each other to achieve maximum
effect, building robust solutions within budget. You probably noticed
this through much of our open source work. From [HaskellR][haskellr],
to [inline-java][inline-java] and [sparkle][sparkle], or our
upcoming
[Terraform NixOS provider][terraform-provider-nixos],
[Funflow][funflow] and [inline-js][inline-js], we build bridges across
languages and across technologies.

Pragmatism is also what has driven us to take some of Rust's DNA and
splice it into Haskell's, to finally achieve readable, composable
programming _that is resource-safe by construction_. This effort gave
rise to a [paper][linear-types-paper] published last year and
a [GHC proposal][linear-types-proposal]. This might be a long-term
project, but nonetheless a long-term project with pragmatic impact,
born out of our experience of years of execution in systems
programming for high-performance computing.

If you are software engineer with strong experience (whether
professional, personal or academic) in any of the above cited
technologies that shares our values taking the long term view towards
pragmatic goals, then please consider applying!

## Where?

We are a distributed team scattered across every single continent
except Africa (working on it!). We have offices in three hubs: Paris,
London and Zürich.

In service of our mission, we gear pretty much our entire strategy
towards bringing together the strongest possible team of engineers.
This means that wherever you are, we want to work with you. But we
believe you'll want to consider relocating to either one of our hubs
(Paris, London or Zürich) to accelerate your experience learning from
your peers.

## What?

We have new projects starting all the time. Here is a sampling of
_fresh_ projects from our current roadmap this year:

- using constraint programming to find the optimal shapes and sizes to
  tile the structure of houses with a revolutionary new ecofriendly
  material;
- applying formal methods and property based testing to analyze
  software specifications of transactions;
- working with experienced teams to assist transitioning large
  polyglot projects to [Bazel][bazel];
- establishing a reproducible workflow for genetic analyses;
- [retargeting][asterius] Haskell to [WebAssembly][webassembly].
