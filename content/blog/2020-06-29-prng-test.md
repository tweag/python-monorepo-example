Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) power property tests and Monte Carlo simulations.
They are also used to model random behaviour in nature and to
initialise machine learning models[^cryptographic-prng]. Their performance and quality matter.

Unfortunately, up to version 1.1, the default PRNG of the
[random][random] library for Haskell was neither very fast nor very
high quality. The [recently announced version
1.2][random-1.2-announcement] fixes this. Random version 1.2 is a
collaboration between Dominic Steinitz, Alexey Kuleshevich, and
myself, with invaluable support from Alexey Khudyakov and Andrew
Lelechenko.

In this blog post, I will focus on how we ensured that the
implementation used in random v1.2 is, indeed, a high quality PRNG.

### Pseudo-random number generators

A PRNG produces from a seed a sequence of approximately uniformly distributed numbers.

```haskell
init :: Seed -> State
next :: State -> (Output, State)
```

This allows us to generate a output sequence `x1, x2, x3, …` as follows:

```haskell
let g0 = init seed
    (x1, g1) = next g0
    (x2, g2) = next g1
    (x3, g3) = next g2
```

This is not always enough though. Often you may want two or more
parallel sequences that are still (approximately) random
even when assembled. Such sequences are said to be
_independent_.

```haskell
split :: State -> (State, State)
```

This can arise when you have different threads. But it's of prime
importance in a lazy language like Haskell, since it makes it possible
to generate deterministic random numbers lazily. For instance, `split` is used in
QuickCheck's [Gen monad][gen-bind].

An easy implementation of `split` is to duplicate the current
state. But, the two parallel sequences will not be independent: indeed
they will be identical. A slightly more sophisticated implementation is to generate
the two split states randomly, but this will typically not yield
independent sequences either.

The `split` function in `random` up to version 1.1 creates generators that are not independent ([#3575][issue-3575], [#3620][issue-3620]).

In a [blog post][prng-performance] comparing the performance of
Haskell PRNG implementations, Alexey Kuleshevich found `splitmix` to
be the fastest pure PRNG written in Haskell, making it the top
candidate to replace the default PRNG in the proposed new version of
`random`. But it also had to be good enough at generating random sequences.

[prng-performance]: https://alexey.kuleshevi.ch/blog/2019/12/21/random-benchmarks/

In the following, I will go through how we tested the `split`
function in `random` version 1.1 and [`splitmix-0.1`][splitmix-0.1], which we used for
version 1.2, in order to make sure that, while in version 1.1 `split`
generates sequences which are not independent, in version 1.2 `split` generates
independent sequences.

## Legacy and SplitMix.

The PRNG used by `random` up to version 1.1 is one of the PRNG
algorithms proposed by [L’Ecuyer][lecuyer-1988], with an ad hoc `split` function
tacked on without statistical justification. We shall refer to this
PRNG as _Legacy_. Since version 1.2, the PRNG is _SplitMix_, a PRNG
designed from the ground up to be splittable, as implemented in the
`splitmix` package.

[lecuyer-1988]: https://doi.org/10.1145/62959.62969

Every PRNG with a finite state is periodic: it will necessarily come
back to the same state after a certain number of iterations, called
its period. In contrast, long sequences of truly random numbers are unlikely to be periodic.
As a result, every PRNG with a finite state is distinguishable from a source of true randomness, at least in theory.

Legacy produces numbers in the range $[1, 2^{31}-5)$ and
has a period of just under $2^{61}$; SplitMix produces numbers in the
range $[0, 2^{64})$ and has a period of exactly $2^{64}$.

Considering the output range and period of Legacy and SplitMix, we see
something interesting: Legacy’s period of roughly $2^{61}$ contains its
range of roughly $2^{31}$ numbers many times over.
For SplitMix, on the other hand, the output range and period are both $2^{64}$. SplitMix in fact generates each output in $[0, 2^{64})$ precisely once.

We actually expect repetitions much more often than that: observing $2^{64}$ numbers where each number in the range $[0, 2^{64})$ occurs exactly once is vanishingly unlikely in a truly random sequence of numbers.
This is is a manifestation of the [Birthday problem][birthday-problem].

[birthday-problem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem

And indeed, SplitMix [fails a test][birthday-fail] that checks specifically that repetitions in the output sequence occur as frequently as expected according to the Birthday problem.

[birthday-fail]: https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/birthday-test.html

How much of an issue is this?
It depends on the application.
Property tests, for example, don’t benefit from repetitions. And if,
as is common,
you only need values in a subrange of the full $[0, 2^{64})$, you will have
many repetitions indeed.

## Reproducible test environment

While certain PRNG properties like output range and period can be determined “by inspection”, there is no clear definition or test for its quality, that is, how similar to uniformly distributed numbers a PRNG’s output sequence is.

The closest thing we have are collections of tests, often called test _batteries_, which empirically check if a PRNG’s output sequence has certain properties expected of a random number sequence -- like the distance between repetitions, the famous Birthday problem mentioned in the previous section.

To make it easy to test PRNGs, we created a [repository][test-repo] with a Nix shell environment to run the most well-known PRNG test batteries.

### Setup

[Nix][nix] is required to use the test environment.
The easiest way to enter it is using this command:

[nix]: https://nixos.org/nix/

```
$ nix-shell https://github.com/tweag/random-quality/archive/master.tar.gz
```

You can test that it works by running PractRand on a truly terrible “PRNG”: `/dev/zero`, which outputs zero bytes. The PractRand binary is called `RNG_test`, passing “stdin32” makes it read unsigned 32-bit integers from standard input:

```
$ RNG_test stdin32 < /dev/zero
```

PractRand should immediately show a large number of test failures. Don’t use `/dev/zero` as a source of random numbers!

### PRNGs

While this post is about testing Legacy and SplitMix, the environment we created can test any PRNG written in any language.
To demonstrate this, we have included programs in C, Python, Perl and Lua, each using the language’s standard PRNG to output a stream of unsigned 32-bit integers[^rand-max].
To see the source code of the generator scripts, run e.g. `cat $(which generate.pl)`.

You can run these programs as `generate.c`, `generate.py`, `generate.pl` and `generate.lua` within the Nix environment.

All the statistical tests in this environment consume binary input.
To convert the hexadecimal 32-bit numbers to binary, pipe them through `xxd -r -p`, e.g. `$ generate.lua | xxd -r -p`.

### Test batteries

The environment contains a collection of PRNG test batteries.
All of them either support reading from standard input or were wrapped to support this.
As a result, all the tests can be run as follows:

- To test a system-provided randomness source, run `$ $TEST < $SOURCE`, e.g. `$ RNG_test stdin32 < /dev/random`
- To test a program that generates pseudo-random numbers, run `$ $PROGRAM | $TEST`, e.g. `$ generate.py | xxd -r -p | RNG_test stdin32`

The test batteries include:

- [PractRand][practrand], the most recent PRNG test in the collection.
  It is adaptive: by default, it will consume random numbers until a significant test failure occurs.

  Example invocation: `$ RNG_test stdin32`

  Help: `$ RNG_test -h`

- [TestU01][testu01], containing the test batteries SmallCrush (`-s`), Crush (`-c`) and BigCrush (`-b`).
  We have wrapped it in the executable `TestU01_stdin`, which accepts input from standard input.

  Example invocation: `$ TestU01_stdin -s`

  Help: `$ TestU01_stdin -h`

## Split sequences

These test batteries test the randomness of individual sequences. But
we want to test whether sequences generated by splits are independent
or not, which involves at least two sequences at a time.

Rather than coming up with new test batteries dedicated to `split`,
[Schaathun][schaathun2015] proposes four sequences built of a
combination of `next` and `split`. These “split sequences”
are traditional (non-splittable) PRNGs built off `next` and
`split`. The split sequences are then fed into regular PRNG tests.

[schaathun2015]: https://doi.org/10.1017/S095679681500012X

Here is the API for splittable PRNGs again:

```haskell
init :: Seed -> State
next :: State -> (Output, State)
split :: State -> (State, State)
```

A naming convention for the result of `split` will come in handy. Let’s say that a generator `g` is split into `gL` and `gR` (for “left” and “right”), that is, `(gL, gR) = split g`.
Then we get `gLL` and `gLR` by applying `split` to `gL` via `(gLL, gLR) = split gL`, etc.
Let’s also call `rX` the output of `next gX`, i.e. `(rLL, _) = next gLL`.

This lets us express concisely the first of the sequences proposed by Schaathun:

```
Sequence S_L: given g, output rL; repeat for g = gR
```

This sequence recurses into the right generator returned by `split` while outputting a number generated by the left generator.
We can visualise the sequence as a binary tree where the nodes are `split` operations.
Asterisk (\*) stands for a generated output, ellipsis (…) is where the next iteration of the sequence continues:

```
     split
     /  \
    *  split
       /  \
      *    …
```

The other sequences can be expressed as follows:

```
Sequence S_R: given g, output rR; repeat for g = gL

     split
     /  \
   split *
   /  \
  …    *
```

```
Sequence S_A: given g, output rR, rLL; repeat for g = gLR

     split
     /  \
   split *
   /  \
  *    …
```

```
Sequence S: given g, output rRLL, rRLR, rRRL, rRRR; repeat for g = gL

          split
         /     \
       …      split
             /     \
        split      split
        /  \       /  \
       *    *     *    *
```

We implemented these sequences in a [test program][generator] which
uses Legacy or SplitMix as the underlying PRNG implementation and outputs the random numbers on stdout.

## Test results for Legacy and SplitMix

The following table shows our test results. We tested with PractRand and TestU01.
The sequences `S`, `S_A`, `S_L` and `S_R` are those discussed above.

The test battery output is usually a p-value per test indicating the probability of the input being random.
We summarise the results as “Fail” or “Pass” here.
Each table cell links to the full result, which includes the full command used to run them.
Since the seeds of the sequences are fixed, you should be able to reproduce the results exactly.

## Conclusion

In this post, I've described how we've made sure that the PRNG used in
the newly released version 1.2 of the `random` library is of high
quality. The legacy PRNG used up to version 1.1 had a poor quality
implementation of the `split` primitive, which we wanted to fix.

To this effect, we created [a general-purpose reproducible PRNG
testing environment][test-repo], which makes it easy to run the most
commonly used PRNG tests using Nix with a minimal amount of setup
work. For testing, we used _split sequences_ to reduce the quality of `split` to
the quality of a traditional PRNG.

For further details, check the [reddit announcement for `random`
1.2][random-1.2-announcement]. And don't hesitate to use our
[repository][test-repo] to setup your own PRNG testing.

Peter Occil’s website is also a great starting point for further reading on PRNGs and PRNG testing, in particular the pages [on PRNGs][occil-random] and [on PRNG functions][occil-randomfunc].

[occil-randomfunc]: https://peteroupc.github.io/randomfunc.html

[^cryptographic-prng]: Security-relevant applications also often require random data. They should not rely on the kinds of PRNGs discussed in this blog post. Instead, security-relevant applications should use cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generators that have been vetted by the cryptographic community for this purpose.
[^rand-max]: In the case of C, if `RAND_MAX` is not equal to 2^32, the program will not output the full 32-bit range and will thus fail statistical tests. The other programs should in theory output numbers in the correct range.
