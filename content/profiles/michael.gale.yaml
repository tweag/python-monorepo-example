shortDescription: |
  Michael is a Software Engineer at Tweag. He enjoys all things to do with programming languages: designing, implementing, using, teaching, and building tools for them. While Michael most enjoys working in Haskell, he also appreciates working with other languages such as Rust and even TypeScript.
bio: |
  Michael worked as a Senior Teaching Fellow (equivalent to Assistant Professor, teaching-only) at the University of Warwick during 2017-2021 where he taught modules on Functional Programming (in Haskell) and Cyber Security. During that time, he taught functional programming to close to a thousand students, making extensive use of property-based testing and emphasising the benefits of reusable and strongly typed code. Michael has a BSc (Hons) Computer Science from the University of Nottingham (2010-2013) where his final year project was about the implementation of a compiler for a Haskell-like language. From 2013, Michael studied towards a PhD at the University of Cambridge where he worked on encoding an object system in Haskell - which he hopes to wrap up in the near future. During his last year at Warwick, Michael won two departmental teaching awards, one for each of his taught modules, and was a finalist for the university-wide teaching award. Aside from software engineering, Michael enjoys teaching, cooking, video and board games, walking, ducks, seals, the colour purple (#3D3051 to be exact), and punting.
