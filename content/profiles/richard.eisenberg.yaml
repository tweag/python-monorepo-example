shortDescription: |
  Richard is Tweag’s Principal Researcher and joined the company to continue
  on his mission to shape the future of high-assurance programming. A core
  GHC contributor and Haskell Foundation board member, Richard has a BA
  in Physics and MS in Computer Science from Harvard, and received his PhD in
  Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Away from
  day-to-day-implementation efforts and publishing papers on the design of
  programming languages and type systems, Richard likes to travel, hike, ski,
  and play board games with his wife and daughter. He lives just outside
  of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA -- though dreams of moving to
  Cambridge, UK, some day.

bio: |
  As an undergraduate, Richard was a teaching assistant for Harvard's
  introductory computer science course. This was great fun -- more fun
  than coding during his summer jobs, in fact. So he decided on a career
  in education, becoming a secondary school teacher. Richard taught
  introductory computer science (in Java) and a little bit of math
  in a boarding school in Massachusetts and then in an international day school
  in London.

  After attending a conference full of happy professors (but short on secondary school
  teachers) and realizing that teaching alone would not satisfy his
  intellectual hunger, Richard changed careers by enrolling for a PhD
  in Computer Science. Five years later, he graduated deeply enmeshed
  in the Haskell community and on a crusade to improve the art of
  computer programming through better static analysis.

  Richard then took a tenure-track job at Bryn Mawr College outside of
  Philadelphia, but found that he could not adequately teach, implement,
  and research. To his own surprise, he found that teaching was the best
  component to jettison, and he thus joined Tweag to broaden his Haskell
  leadership and research contributions.
