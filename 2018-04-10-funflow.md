In this blog post, we'd like to officially announce Funflow, a system we've been
working on for the last few months with a small number of clients. Funflow is a
system for building and running workflows. In this blog post we'll talk about
what that entails, why we built funflow, and what we'd like to do with it in the future.

What is a workflow?
========

At its core, a workflow takes some inputs and produce some outputs, possibly
producing some side effects along the way. Of course, this description basically
describes any program. Workflow systems distinguish themselves in a few ways:

- A workflow is often composed of a number of steps, which may themselves be
  independent programs (or workflows). Composition of this higher level of
  programs might be done by domain specialists rather than programmers.
- Workflows are often long running, with some likelihood of failure halfway
  through. In such cases, we would want to resume them midway through without
  needing to rerun the earlier stages.
- Likewise, workflows may often need to be run on clusters or across distributed
  systems.

Workflow systems have perhaps seen the most use in the business process space,
where they allow non-programmers to automate business processes (such as
authorising a purchase order) which may involve multiple steps, some of which
are automatic, and others which might involve human intervention.

Another area heavily involving workflows, and one in which we are particularly
interested, is in scientific data processing. For example, in bioinformatics
one might develop a workflow (also often called 'pipeline' in this space) to
perform some in-silico analysis of sequenced gene data. Such a workflow will
be customised for a particular task, and may then be run for each sequenced
sample.
