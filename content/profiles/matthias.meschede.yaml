shortDescription: |
  Matthias initiates and coordinates projects at Tweag. He says he's a
  generalist "half scientist, half musician, and a third half of other things"
  but you'll have to ask him what that means exactly! He lives in Paris, and
  is regularly in Tweag's Paris office where you'll most likely find him in a
  discussion, writing long-form texts in vim or reading and occasionally
  writing code.
bio: |
  Matthias started at university with general physics, biophysics, and then got
  a phd and postdoc in geophysics working in seismology on wave propagation,
  tomography, and signal processing, contributing to conferences and open
  source software in the field, before switching to the software industry and
  joining Tweag.

  Matthias has experience with a variety of programming languages and
  frameworks, from large acadmic numerical codes, the Python data stack,
  frontend frameworks in Elm or Pure/Java/Typescript, to Haskell. Working at
  Tweag, Matthias discovered and learned to love Nix and NixOS. He worked on
  modeling for a large part of his career using approaches like Bayesian
  statistics or data-driven machine learning and always enjoyed putting
  together nice and effective visualizations to communicate the results.

  On the musical side, he plays multiple instruments (Cello, double bass,
  piano, didgeridoo), and lately concentrates a lot on improvisation,
  composition and contemporary music (some call it noise).

  But his experience living in different countries and experience working on a
  large variety of projects accross domains, cultures, communities and
  technology is equally important to him than any specialization and probably
  one of the most useful skills in his current role.
