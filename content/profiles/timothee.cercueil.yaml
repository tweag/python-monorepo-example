shortDescription: |
  Timothee is an engineer who specializes in embedded systems
  development, software security and the Linux kernel.
  He learnt Python as a hobby, using it as a tool to automate everything he wants on Linux,
  then did a lot of embedded programming in C during his studies, and later fell in love with Rust.
bio: |
  Before becoming a Tweager, he did an internship at ST Microelectronics
  where he worked on a secure bootchain using ARM TrustZone, and
  contributed to several open source projects including U-boot, Linux and OP-TEE.

  He grew up knowing the online forum communities, where age and origin doesn't matter and
  everyone is treated equal, around the same center of interests.
  Also interested in distributed systems, genetic algorithms, mathematics and finance, he tries to
  learn everything, from everyone, at anytime.

  When not working on his own projects, he mostly spends his time playing
  musical instruments (guitar, jaw harp, his voice and multiple kinds of flutes),
  composing music and rediscovering retrogaming gems.
