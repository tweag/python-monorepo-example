bio: |
  Nick is a software architect dedicated to assuring correctness by discovering
  and encoding the most useful domain abstractions. He enjoys close cooperation
  with experts to enable and support the re-expression of their knowledge as
  semi-formal, formal, and even executable specifications. His most trusty tool
  has been Haskell. Other interests include: consensus building, tutorial
  writing, knowledge sharing presentations, professional development, all kinds
  of games, speculative fiction, dogs, hiking, and culinary adventures!
