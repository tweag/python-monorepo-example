  has recently worked on a programming language with algebraic effects and 
  handlers for his undergraduate thesis. 

  He is passionate about writing correct software that can have impacts on 
  a global scale. He has also made several open source contributions to .NET,

  go on walks, watch shows, and hang out with his friends.
