shortDescription: |
  Vince works on software development projects, some internal and some for clients.
  Initially self-taught in basic Java programming, Vince was led by course of study and general curiosity to programming in other languages. 
  Eventually he was hooked on Scala and interested by Haskell, which of course naturally led him to Tweag.
  At Tweag Vince enjoys interacting with colleagues who come from broad range of places of origin and current residence, and the array of perspectives that follow naturally from that.
bio: |
  Vince has education in math and statistics but moved into more software-focused work after university, initially in network security and then in public health and genomics / bioinformatics.
  Besides interest in the domain switch itself, he was excited by the opportunity to have more of his work be available as open-source software, and he loves that Tweag holds open source availability as a core value.

  After detouring for graduate school, Vince decided that he prefers the generality of problems and solutions in software development and returned to full-time focus on that.
  Vince has worked in a range of settings, from three-person bioinformatics labs in nonprofit research to network security research in a large enterprise setting. 
  From this experiential diversity both in application topic and in organization types, he has developed structural flexibility and honed the ability to quickly pick up new domain-specific information.

  Vince is a primary contributor to a number of open-source bioinformatics packages in Python. 
  Aside from software, he likes running, mountains, museums, linguistic nuance, learning about public policy, and wandering around any city to find new places.
  Fortunately, some of these preferred activities are readily combined.
