bio: |
  Juan is a software engineer who supports mainly Haskell and Nix projects at
  Tweag, but is not afraid of working with any kind of technology clients are
  willing to use, from SQL to Python to Javascript. He is also an editor for
  Tweag's blog, helping writers on both content and presentation. Prior to
  joining Tweag, Juan was in academia where he worked among biologists,
  physicists and computer scientists on the embryogenesis of multiple model
  animals, researching physical and computational problems. He has a PhD from
  the Université Paris-Saclay and a MSc from the École Polytechnique, both on
  complex systems science.
