  Currently, Facundo is leading our collaboration with the authors of Liquid
  Haskell to integrate SMT solvers into the day-to-day practices of the
  software industry. He is also the maintainer of inline-java and sparkle, and
  has made multiple contributions to GHC, rules_haskell, and the Haskell
  libraries. His everyday activities include elaborating project proposals,
  development, software verification, and mentoring.

  He received a MSc in Computer Science at Universidad de la República in
  Montevideo, researching program transformation techniques. Since then he
  worked in software projects for education, entertainment, finance, scientific
  computation, and government.

  Round-the-clock parent, amateur gardener and guitar player, Facundo spends
