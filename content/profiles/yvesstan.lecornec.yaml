bio: |
  Yves-Stan is a Software Engineer and is especially interested in
  automatic techniques and tooling that foster writing correct code.
  Prior to joining the Tweag team, Yves-Stan worked as INRIA research
  engineer at the Paris ENS, doing static analysis of C code by
  abstract interpretation. Prior to that he had a postdoctoral
  position at the Lyon ENS, working on a web application designed to
  build models of biological systems. His PhD at the university of
  Evry related to model checking, developing methods to analyse
  modular systems using hierarchical abstractions.
