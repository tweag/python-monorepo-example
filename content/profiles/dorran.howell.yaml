shortDescription: |
  Dorran is a data engineer with expertise in data pipelines and ML
  engineering.

bio: |
  Dorran studied geology at ETH Zürich where he applied Bayesian modeling
  techniques to model subsurface geologic structures using
  remote sensing and geochemical data.

  Before joining Tweag, Dorran worked at Enverus where he
  developed data pipelines and Python extensions to the company’s geophysical
  modeling application. Outside of work, Dorran enjoys running and hiking in
  the Alps with his wife and border collie.

  Tweagers know that whatever Dorran does works! He's fun to work with, has
  great skills, but is also considerate, humble and a good team player! He is
  enthusiastic about everything, but particularly about making sense out of
  data and tidying up code and databases.
