  In recent years, languages like Haskell have seen a dramatic surge of new
  features that significantly extends the expressive power of their type
  systems. With these features, the challenge of kind inference for datatype
  declarations has presented itself and become a worthy research problem on
  its own. This paper studies kind inference for datatypes. Inspired by
  previous research on type-inference, we offer declarative specifications for
  what datatype declarations should be accepted, both for Haskell98 and for a
  more advanced system we call PolyKinds, based on the extensions in modern
  Haskell, including a limited form of dependent types. We believe these
  formulations to be novel and without precedent, even for Haskell98. These
  specifications are complemented with implementable algorithmic versions. We
  study soundness, completeness and the existence of principal kinds in these
  systems, proving the properties where they hold. This work can serve as a
  guide both to language designers who wish to formalize their datatype
  declarations and also to implementors keen to have principled inference of
  principal types.
