bio: |
  Daniel is a software engineer at Tweag, with a keen interest in deterministically building and deploying software.
  His professional work has largely revolved around and writing software to deploy and manage server infrastructure.
  Dan first studied geography at university, focusing on the applications of GIS to human geography.
  He then studied computer science, with a particular interest in distributed systems,
  while administering the systems of non-profit community organizations.
  He then went on to build tooling to test and deploy Kubernetes clusters.

  Daniel is always excited about learning new technologies,
  and supporting the development of open source tools that solve real world problems.
  He became excited about Nix and NixOS several years ago,
  and has used them for personal and consulting projects, contributed to the open source ecosystem, and participated in Summer of Nix.

  Dan lives in Montreal, Canada.
  Outside of work performs music regularly, playing klezmer music on the tsimbl (hammered dulcimer).
  He combines his interests in traditional music, computer science, and social sciences with an interest
  in the field of computational ethnomusicology, and has worked on a project to digitize
  and build a knowledge graph of klezmer manuscripts.
