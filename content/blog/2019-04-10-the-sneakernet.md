After an unprecedented effort of scientists all over the world, the [Event
Horizon Telescope](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) team has released the
first image ever taken of a blackhole.

The image is generated by correlating petabytes of data, which are shipped from
the telescopes to the data centers _in hard disks via airplane_. It turns out
that this is way faster than using those old-school cables. Once more,
innovation has been brought to us from our modern philosophers, this time
staring into a lens pointed to the dark sky, last time staring into a lens
pointed on tiny objects in a cave - the physicists.

As a new-school enterprise, Tweag immediately realized the potential of
shipping hard disks and did a quick explorative study about future possibilities
of this technology called the [Sneakernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet):
Could we give a new life to the [homing pigeon](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149)
industry? How about transportation means that are optimized to carry incredible
amounts of weight? How about transportation means that are designed to be fast
as a bullet?

Consider a 4 terabytes (TB), 60 grams, 100 X 70 X 7 mmÂ³ disk SSD disk. To get
good transfer rates, we need to ship as many of these disks as fast as possible
from one place to another. It's all about _shipping capacity_ and _speed_.

For instance, a human can carry about 30kg and walk around 5km/h. 30kg
corresponds to 7500 of those 4TB hard disks. This means that a human can carry
around 30,000 TB of data!

In case that this number doesn't speak to you: it corresponds to 30,000,000 GB.
Doesn't speak to you either? Well, it's 30 PB. Still not happy? Let's go back
to old-school technology then: 30 PB corresponds to the entire internet traffic of
one month [_in the year 1999_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic#Global_Internet_traffic).
Just think back and remember the endless ISDN and modem transfers of mp3's and
images, then think about what you can squeeze into a 4 TB hard disk and you'll
believe me.

The second factor that determines the transfer rate of a human carrier is
speed. After all we have to bring our 30 PB of data from A to B and we want to
do this in as little time as possible. The good old philosophical allegory
_time = distance / speed_ comes to help. Let's say I walk 10 m to bring 30 PB
of data to my colleagues office. Not considering the time that it will take her
to prepare and clean her disk, this would take about 7 seconds, in line with
[Adam Ries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ries) (Germans know why).

The Sneakernet transfer rate equation is thus:

```
time_from_A_to_B = speed / distance
storage_capacity = load_capacity / disk_weight x disk_storage_space
rate = storage_capacity / time_from_A_to_B
```

A human is neither optimized for speed nor for load capacity (are we actually
optimized for something?). Planes and ships fare much better in this sense. It
turns out that a plane ([Boeing 747 LCF with 200,000kg load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Dreamlifter))
can carry the semi-satanic number of 3,333,333 hard disks that
store _13 exabytes of data_.
That used to be the entire internet traffic of one month [_in the year 2009_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic#Global_Internet_traffic)!
Remember: Google, Youtube and all of these things came up and you need a plane
to handle this kind of data. The plane is also fast enough to deliver this data
internationally with reasonable delay. However there might be some package loss
with certain providers.

Now brace yourself. There are ships called mammoth ultra large crude carriers
(ULCCs) [that can carry 550,000 Deadweight Tons
(DWTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker). They can deliver a shipload
of 9,166,666,666 hard disks, containing 36,666 EB in total. A single shipload
can fit the entire internet traffic of 2018 25 times! As you know, the internet
barely exists for this long and traffic rates were much lower for most of its
history.  This brings us to the even bigger conclusion that _a single shipload
of SSD hard disks can store the entire traffic that has ever been exchanged in
the history of the internet_.

Wow, that's impressive. Here is a little graph that shows how the Sneakernet
compares to more traditional technology:

What about the time needed for loading and unloading data from the disks? And
the food that the pigeons need to fly such large distances? What is the best
sneaker brand for transferring data by hand?

We are sure that these questions can be answered and that the Sneakernet is the
future. Besides the packet loss problem, that can become... problematic. And
that so many hard disks don't actually exist. Details.
