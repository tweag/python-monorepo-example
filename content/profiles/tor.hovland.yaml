shortDescription: |
  Tor is a Rust developer at Tweag who lives in Trondheim, Norway with his wife
  and two sons.
bio: |
  Tor has an M.Sc. in theoretical physics, and wrote a thesis on quantum 
  computing 20 years before it became cool.

  He has many years experience building software, both as a consultant and from
  within a software company that does lots of interesting work within the
  energy business.

  Tor is particularly absorbed in the challenge of building software that can
  be effectively maintained for many years. To that end, automated testing has
  always been a helpful tool. So has advanced languages with strong type
  systems and strict compilers. This is why he finds Rust so appealing.

  Outside work, Tor can usually be found on one of his bikes. He does
  long-distance cycling, and enjoys life to the fullest on events such as
  Paris-Brest-Paris, London-Edinburgh-London, and 1001 Miglia Italia. Go and
  see his YouTube channel!
