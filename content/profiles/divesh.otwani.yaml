bio: |
  Divesh is a Software Engineer with a strong background in fancy type-level
  Haskell and rigorous mathematics. Before joining Tweag, Divesh worked on
  optimizing polyhedral compilers targeting supercomputers in a research lab in
  NYC. He graduated from Haverford College with a double major in Mathematics
  and Computer Science.

  In his free time, he likes reading classic works of literature, poetry, doing
  abstract math and practicing martial arts. Divesh is known at Tweag as a great
  person to have philosophical debates with, for example on long walks through
  Paris when he is visiting the office.
