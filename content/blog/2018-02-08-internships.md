Tweag I/O is inviting applications from students for our paid internship
programme this summer. If you're a student excited about working with Haskell,
Nix and similar things, then get in touch!

In previous years, our interns have worked on a variety of projects
across research and engineering, including:

- adding
  a [type system](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-05-23-typing-nix.html) to
  the `nix` language,
- creating a new low-level network abstraction layer Haskell
  specialized for low-latency applications,
- designing and implementitng a functional reactive programming (FRP)
  framework that can run distributed on many nodes,
- adding linear types to a streaming library...

We have a few ideas for projects which you might want to work on (see the bottom
of this post for details), or feel free to propose one of your own. We're happy
to also consider research projects that would form part of a dissertation.

Internships would most likely be on a remote basis, though if you're
local to Paris, London or Zürich, then we could also host you at our
Paris office or work semi-remotely in London and Zürich. If you're in
one of the countries where we have a strong presence then we would
also try to arrange reguar meetings with advisors at a mutually
convenient location (UK, France, Switzerland, Russia, Australia).

Here are potential project ideas:

- adding a type system for directory trees for use in
  [funflow](https://github.com/tweag/funflow),
- implementing a monadic streaming JSON parser,
- extending the GHC plugin system to support more powerful static pointers,
- Writing a webapp which allows graphical composition of Funflow
  workflows.

To apply, or to ask for more information or to discuss an idea for a project
you'd like to consider working on, drop us an email with a brief resume at
jobs@tweag.io.
