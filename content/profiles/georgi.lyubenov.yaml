shortDescription: |
  Georgi is a Haskell engineer with strong interests in static guarantees, correct data modelling, developer experience and teaching.
  He is constantly trying to improve himself and the status quo in these areas, by trying to leverage newer technologies when appropriate.
bio: |
  After struggling with C++ throughout his school and university years, Georgi's love for programming was resurrected when
  he met the world of statically typed structural functional programming in the form of Haskell. From then on he has been on a
  neverending pursuit for "beautiful" programs - ones that are easy to write and reason about, by the way of correct data modelling
  and compiler pedantry. Along the way he picked up a passion for teaching and hyping up how much easier programming can be,
  as well as interests in computer-aided reasoning and formal logic.

  After wetting his feet in lots of the gnarly bits an industrial setting offers, Georgi has come to Tweag to seek ways
  in which other technologies, such as Nix, can help improve himself and the world of software engineering and programming.

  Outside of work, Georgi enjoys preaching the gospel of statically typed functional programming, pushing himself on boulder climbing,
  optimising his development experience, making the world of programming more accessible to his students,
  correct-by-construction programming in dependently typed programming languages, video games and anime.
