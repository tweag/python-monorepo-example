bio: |
  Mark started with functional programming by chance when he discovered
  Common Lisp in 2014. Soon afterward, his journey brought him to Haskell,
  which he explored frenetically producing numerous popular Haskell
  libraries, tools, tutorials, and blog posts. This attracted attention of
  Tweag, which he joined in 2018.

  At Tweag, rather than choosing to work only in Haskell, Mark sought to
  diversify his toolkit by learning about Bazel, Nix, and other functional
  programming languages like OCaml and Rust. These days Mark considers himself
  a generalist who strives to be involved at all stages of consulting business
  from hiring to sales. He also enjoys leading teams and figuring out how to
  bring complex projects to completion. Born in Russia, Mark currently lives in
  Paris, France. In his free time he is an avid reader, writer, photographer,
  musician, and painter.

  Mark is passionate about many topics, and known as a curious, fast learner at
  Tweag who has a sharpeyed sense of observation. He is a fascinating and
  reliable colleague striving for simplicity and good judgement day to day.
