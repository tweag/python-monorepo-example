bio: |
  "Aloïs started coding at an early age in Switzerland and got interested in functional programming by following the development happening at the Scala laboratory in Lausanne.
  It's only later while working in the UK that he had the opportunity to put this programming style into practice and he never looked back since then!
  Lately, he's been interested in applying those practices in the domain of DevOps and helping Tweag clients with their usage of Nix."
