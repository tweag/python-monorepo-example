shortDescription: |
  Alexei is a generalist software engineer who is passionate about composable and
  scalable approaches to all stages of software engineering, as well as open-source
  advocacy.
bio: |
  Coming from a diverse background of full-stack web applications and nuclear
  accelerator control systems, Alexei has a wide overview of the state of
  affairs in the tech world. Displeased with this state, often tripping over
  problems long solved, he found his way to Haskell, Rust, Nix, and NixOS,
  which re-ignited his love for technology, especially open-source software.

  In addition to tackling technical challenges, he is equally at home with
  the sometimes even trickier challenge of building and maintaining happy
  teams, with a focus on good communication and empathy. He feels happiest
  in companies that value people above all else; and Tweag is such a company!

  When not on the clock, Alexei enjoys applying his collaborative
  problem solving skills in the kitchen, likes to pester people with a camera,
  and is a notorious board game hoarder.
