shortDescription: |
  Carl is a mathematician who took a liking to computers. He enjoys when
  foundations suddenly become applied; when the answer to some deep
  question is actually implementable, useful, and, importantly, fun to
  work with. If we strive for the ideal of "software correct by design",
  the road towards that goal has to be enjoyable!

bio: |
  Carl was "awakened" when he stumbled upon the Homotopy Type Theory
  book. Perhaps not surprisingly, he did not understand most of it on
  the first reading, but his worldview was transformed and he began to
  get interested in computer formalisations of mathematics. (Some would
  say he neglected his curriculum over playing around in Coq.)

  From this starting point, he began to explore all the clever ideas
  that have already gone into making software more correct. This process
  of learning is still going on, and Carl hopes to find many others who
  are going to learn together with him.

  Music has always played an important part in Carl's life, and away
  from work he spends most of his time singing in an unreasonable
  number of choirs, composing, or playing the piano.
