bio: |
  Some of you have already met her or maybe seen her name pop up on slack: Nour El Mawass Nour El Mawass joined Tweag this week. She is Lebanese, and currently lives in a southern suburb of Paris. Besides Lebanon, Nour El Mawass Nour lived in Riyadh and Munich ("but I managed to forget most of the German I learned so no, ich spreche nicht Deutsch, in case you’re wondering").

  Nour El Mawass Nour also comes from academia as many of us, with an unusually wide and interesting background: She got her Masters in Electrical Engineering in Lebanon, then worked on machine learning and data pipeline problems as researcher at King Saud University in Riyadh on pervasive and urban computing, continued with a PhD in Rouen, France, and then lately as postdoc at the university of technology of Troyes (UTT) on alerting and anomaly detection with NLP techniques in the social media context. During her career, she already worked with industry on smaller projects and interned at Google Munich where she built an ML pipeline for their internal launch management system.

  This industry experience seems to have been decent, because, after accumulating 15 publications in academia, she now fully jumped over!

  In her free time, Nour El Mawass Nour does not play a musical instrument: "I desperately want to play Oud  [M: this] or Qanun [M: this] but I know that, realistically, I will never have the time to learn" :) But fortunately there is also gardening, reading ("I am a certified bookworm") and writing historical fantasy ("yes that’s a thing, and no I am nowhere near published"). And then, Nour El Mawass Nour is practitioner of this all-encompassing, attractive meta hobby: "I have managed to turn these hobbies into things I should track (with charts and graphics), research (by scouring Youtube, Google and the local libraries), and optimize (with arduino irrigation systems) so they don’t feel like hobbies anymore.".

  With this in mind, it seems "Welcome to Tweag Nour El Mawass Nour" is just natural evolution :)
