shortDescription: |
  Software engineer interested in compilers, programming language design and
  ergonomics, type theory, and more recently the design of correct and
  composable build systems. Currently in Paris.
bio: |
  Previously a student of algebraic number theory, Swann comes to software
  engineering from a mathematical background. This led him to Haskell in his
  teenage years, and then to several years of implementing type systems and
  learning about the theory of programming languages, interests that continue
  to animate him to this day and inform his approaches to practical technical
  problems.

  Currently, Swann works on the Scalable Builds team at Tweag, where he works to
  improve the adoption of modern build systems and tooling. He has recently begun
  contributing to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and works on efforts to improve
  programming language ergonomics with better compiler feedback.

  In his time away from programming, Swann is an avid cook partial to southern
  and southwestern Chinese cuisine, a linguistics enthusiast and language
  learner, and an occasional 8-string guitarist, and can often be seen on a bike
  or on bouldering walls around Paris.
