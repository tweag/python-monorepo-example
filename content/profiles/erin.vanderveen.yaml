shortDescription: |
  Erin is a software engineer with experience in creating web-based functional
  programs, maintaining a functional programming language and designing and
  implementing tools enhancing developer productivity. His personal goal is to
  get as many people as possible working with functional programming languages.
bio: |
  Erin studied Computing Science at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. First a
  bachelor specialising in Cyber Security and subsequently a Masters on
  Software Science, focusing on Functional Programming. An Erasmus exchange to
  Ume√• University gave him the possibility to work with the Kebnekaise and
  Abisko computers, writing highly optimised and parallel programs. He finished
  his Master's degree with a thesis on integrating uniqueness typing with an
  embedded DSL to allow mutable arrays.

  While working on his thesis, Erin was also involved with a project to port
  the Clean language to the ARM64 platform to allow the language to run on the
  latest iteration of Raspberry Pis.

  His work with the Clean programming language lead him to join TOP Software, a
  spin-off company developing the iTasks framework. Here he was responsible for
  creating the Clean language server, implementing an alternative build system,
  maintaining the core libraries, and building software for the Dutch Royal
  Coastguard.

  Erin discovered Nix and NixOS in 2021 and implemented a prototype for an
  alternative build system for Clean that could run on NixOS. He also designed
  a further iteration of this build system that would leverage Nix itself to
  build Clean programs.

  He joined Tweag in late 2021, looking to apply his skills to a language and
  ecosystem different from Clean's.
