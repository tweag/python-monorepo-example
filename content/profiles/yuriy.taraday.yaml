bio: |
  Yuriy is a software engineer with 11 years of professional background in
  different areas. He started working on Microsoft .Net and MSSQL based payment
  system, suffered through Suse and weird open source CRM systems written in
  Java, spent a big chunk of life fixing OpenStack in Python, and ended up
  leading the creation and development of a Kubernetes as a Service system in
  Go. He always thought that the functional programming paradigm is the right
  one but didn't have a chance to properly apply it until finding out about Nix
  several years ago and using it to finally achieve predictable OS
  configuration. He then started diving into Bazel to get similar experience
  during development. He is a big fan of making his own life as a developer
  easier and inflicting these benefits on others.
