shortDescription: |
  Nicolas is a software engineer at Tweag. He lives a busy life travelling
  between Paris and Amsterdam with his cat and between theoretical and practical
  aspects of computing with his work. Nicolas enjoys when theoretical notions
  meet low-level objects to build automated verification tools. On the side, he
  spends a lot of time playing and writing music, cycling, and dancing Scottish
  country dances.

bio: |
  Nicolas has been studying theoretical and foundational computer science since
  university. Because he loved it but needed a more concrete dimension to his
  work, he went to do a PhD on applying formal methods to real-world systems,
  and the Debian GNU/Linux distribution in particular. He then wrote several
  research articles and presented his work in various seminars and international
  conferences, including technical ones such as the Debian conference. After his
  PhD, he switched to the software industry and joined Tweag, hoping to increase
  the impact of formal methods on the industrial world.

  Nicolas has knowledge ranging from foundations of mathematics and logic to
  low-level systems and networks, not forgetting programming in various
  languages, both imperative and functional. His favourite approach is to
  combine all of those, applying theoretical tools to reason about low-level
  objects and writing code to do that automatically. For his implementations, he
  favours strongly-typed functional languages such as OCaml, although he has a
  guilty pleasure for interestingly-designed languages such as Shell or PHP. He
  enjoys working in teams, meeting new people and communicating his work with
  the world, whether through text or in person.

  Outside of work, Nicolas alternates between his lives in Paris and Amsterdam.
  He spends a considerable amount of time playing and writing music, playing
  cards and board games, cycling, and dancing Scottish country dances. The
  latter leads him to travel regularly all over the world to participate in
  international events. He can prove to be very convincing and, who knows, maybe
  you will find yourself dancing with him sooner than you think?
