      - I worked on adding linear types to GHC. This involved large-scale
        merging work and accounting for many interactions of linear types
        with existing features in the compiler - data constructors,
        Template Haskell, Core and so on. The branch was merged in June 2020
        and will be released in GHC 9.0.
      - I am working with Zeus Logics on automatisation of supply chains.
        The project uses Haskell, PureScript and Nix. It involves collection
        of documents from freight forwarders, tracking location of containers,
        submission of declarations to US Customs.

      - Codility is a recruitment tool. Programmers applying for a job
        are asked to solve a simple problem that is later automatically graded.
        I worked in depth on essentially every subsystem in Codility -
        Django frontend, assessment engine, customer invoice statistics,
        new algorithmic tasks, integrations with external services,
        database migrations, deployment scripts, build system etc.
        I introduced new types of user accounts, everyday production deployments,
        participated in firefighting many times and more. Over 6000 commits in total.
