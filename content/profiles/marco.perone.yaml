shortDescription: |
  Marco loves to learn, experiment and try new things. He is interested in ideas, patterns and software architectures,
  with a definite preference for code quality and functional programming.
bio: |
  Marco is a mathematician turned into a software developer.

  Lover of precision and formalism, he enjoys writing high quality software, constantly looking for ways to create
  safer and more reliable code.

  Particularly interested in functional programming, its links to domain modelling, and how to introduce and apply its
  ideas in non-functional languages.

  When he is away from the keyboard, you can probably find him hiking on a mountain or riding his bike around Europe,
  or most probably eating some good dark chocolate.

        Working in PHP on the evolution and maintenance of the platform, based on an Event Sourcing/CQRS architecture.
        I introduced [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), to get types in PHP through static analysis and I created the
        [lamphpda](https://github.com/marcosh/lamphpda/) library to use Higher Kinded Types and functional programming
        data structures in PHP.
        I introduced Dhall for configuration management and Haskell for the new version of the company risk engine.
