    location: Wellington, New Zealand
    description:
      - We built a platform to provide local governments with data and
        insights that can help them plan more effectively. With networks
        of innovative sensors for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, air
        quality and more, we gathered data that cities could combine
        with their own geographical datasets and then freely analyse and
        intuitively visualise the results in 2D and VR.

      - I helped the team make great technical decisions so that our
        software could grow smoothly with our customers' needs and run
        reliably, leaving us to focus on enabling our customers to serve
        their citizens. I also wrote a big chunk of the software myself,
        while coaching the less experienced developers, and took care of
        setting up a highly available CI and deployment environment.

      - The business unit was de-funded by NEC Global and ceased work in
        August 2018. The software is still in use by customers.
