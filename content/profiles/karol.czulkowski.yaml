bio: |
  Karol graduated in the control theory and robotics field but software development
  was what he's found interesting for him.

  During his career he worked for various companies but the vast majority of
  that time he has spent at Intel where he worked for the Datacenter and Networking
  divisions. Apart from that he also possesses some experience working for financial
  institutions.

  At some point of time he has discovered functional programming which opened
  new era in life. He begun with Scala but now targets Haskell.

  Started from C/C++, then moved to C#/Java and finally ended up with Scala/Haskell.
  Worked for huge, corporate-like organizations and now landed at Tweag.
