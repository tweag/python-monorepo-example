bio: |
  Mathieu was a scientist fancying himself as an engineer, then an
  engineer fancying himself as a scientist, and now a leader fancying
  himself as an engineer or a scientist. His background is in formal
  methods, compiler design, and distributed systems. These days
  developer experience is what makes him too excited to sleep at
  night. Unless he's been cycling in sunny Greece, which is most days.

  Mathieu holds a PhD in computer science from École Polytechnique.
