  Though a Data Engineer by trade, Connor is a vocal proponent of functional
  programming, expressive type systems, formal methods, and proof engineering.
  He strives to create correct, highly scalable, and performant systems.
bio: |
  Connor's career in software began while he was pursuing a Bachelor of Science
  in Computer Science at George Mason University. During his first summer at
  George Mason, he was hired as an intern by a defense contractor to help build
  a dataflow and analytics platform to secure the government's cyber
  infrastructure. Connor was so valuable, and his work so impactful, that he
  was hired as a full employee despite not yet completing his degree.

  In this role, Connor learned a great deal about architecting event-driven
  systems and the benefits a cloud-native solution can provide when compared to
  one created by composing COTS software. Having experienced developing,
  operating, and maintaining a greenfield solution, Connor is acutely aware of
  the impact that DevSecOps and best practices have not only code quality, but
  also on team morale.

  Now at Tweag, Connor is excited to apply all that he has learned to deliver
  value frequently and reliably to the clients and projects he has the
  opportunity to support. He enjoys using Nix to create and easily reproduce
  environments and Haskell to write clean, minimally effectful code.

  Outside of work, Connor spends most of his time learning about Nix, SMT
  solver-enabled languages (LiquidHaskell, Cryptol, Dafny, and F*), and
  dependently-typed languages, which double as interactive theorem-provers
  (Idris and Lean). Though he is not (yet!) proficient with them, Connor hopes
  one day use these tools to reliably build software which is correct by
  construction.
