shortDescription: |
  José Luis is a pragmatic programmer who fell in love with functional
  programming after learning about Clojure and Nix.
  Around 2017 he installed NixOS on his laptop and never looked back. He is
  always interested in learning more about any topic related to programming.

bio: |
  José Luis was always interested in technology and computers, which led him to
  study Computer Engineering. Working as a software engineer since 2007,
  mainly on web-related projects, he has worked with a wide range of
  programming languages, like Java, Typescript, Go, Rust and Clojure.

  He started his career working with Java and Python, but after some years, he
  switched to functional programming languages. In particular, Nix and Clojure
  resonated with him.

  When working on a new project, he likes to get the full picture, and to work
  on all the different sides, from the web frontend to the server
  configuration. José Luis defends the goodness of functional programming and
  Nix but recognizes that the most important part of a project is the people.
  He believes in empowering people, reaching agreements, and encouraging
  communication to get better outcomes.
