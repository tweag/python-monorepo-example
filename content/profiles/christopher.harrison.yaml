shortDescription: |
  Chris is a recovering mathematician and software engineer at Tweag. He
  has spent his career working for academia, from both the
  business and the research sides of the industry. He particularly
  enjoys writing well-tested, maintainable code that serves a pragmatic
  end, with a side-helping of DevOps to keep services ticking with
  minimal fuss.

bio: |
  Outside his STEM roots, Chris enjoys more analogue pursuits; the more
  creative, the better. This has largely manifested itself in, amongst
  other things, language and the written word, cooking and baking (he's
  a trained chocolatier), nature watching and road cycling.
