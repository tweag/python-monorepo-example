The time has come again to invite applications for Tweag I/O's paid internship
programme this summer. For the past few years Tweag has taken on a number of
students interested in developing their experience working on projects of
benefit to the wider programming community. This is one way of making an
investment into this community, both through the projects worked on and through
developing the people who will contribute to the community in years to come.

This year we're open to internships in three areas (or some mix of these):
Haskell, Nix and data science. We're also open to longer, research driven
internships (perhaps aligned with a thesis) if you have something in those
areas.

Last year, we had interns working on adding a [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/)
compiler to [Funflow](https://github.com/tweag/funflow), contributing to
implementing linear types in GHC, and building a new library for futures
in Haskell.

This year, we have some ideas for potential projects based on work we're doing:
- Building an interactive exploration of the nix dependency graph based on
  [Mapping open source
  software](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-02-06-mapping-open-source.html).
- Improving existing tooling around logging, resource pools or metrics in Haskell.
- Improving error reporting from GHC.
- Implementing GHC-as-a-service, allowing builds to be submitted to a server
  with pre-warmed cache and across multiple projects.

We'd also be very keen to hear about your ideas for things to work on. These can
be existing projects which could benefit from some concerted effort, or novel
ideas which you would like assistance in implementing. They should contribute in
some way to the Haskell/Nix/data science communities, and should be achievable
in a 2-3 month internship.

Here's the basic facts for anyone interested in applying:
- *Time*: we're expecting that most people would be looking at a summer internship
  between June and August, but we're flexible on this - if some other time would
  work better for you, that's fine.
- *Length*: Typically 3 months. We might make exceptions for longer,
  research-driven internships if you have a good proposal.
- *Location*: Either on site in Paris or remote.
- *Payment*: We use the same payment scale as used by the [Google Summer of Code
  projects](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends).
- *Mentorship*: All students will be assigned a mentor who will support the
  project. Mentors will meet with students at least once per week.

To be able to benefit most from these internships, you should already have some
experience in the area you want to apply in, such as to be able to work mostly
independently and benefit from mentorship. However, the emphasis is on learning,
so you don't need to already be an expert!

If you're interested, please apply via
https://boards.greenhouse.io/tweag/jobs/4188132002, which will ask you for:
- An up-to-date CV
- An idea of projects you might like to work on
- Your location and availability (when you might like to carry out the internship)

We're expecting to start scheduling interviews in the next couple of weeks.
