            <p>
              Tweag engineers are experienced with software development, data
              science, or with the associated infrastructure. Our engineers join
              teams in small startups or large multinationals around the world
              to help them realize software projects that go beyond the current
              state of the art.

              Maths, physics, computer science, geoscience, biology, arts, or
              nothing in particular: if you can produce quality code and use
              computers to solve real-world problems, you are at the right
              place.

            <i className="icon-arrow-right1"></i> Intern
            <p>
              Tweag interns work remotely or in our headquarters in Paris on
              research topics or new applications. The focus of an internship is
              to learn and to make headway with a real problem.
              <br />
              <br />
              Tweag proposes individually tailored projects and mentorship for
              each intern. Openings vary but usually appear from the end of the
              year until early spring.

              Tweag Fellows are independent developers, programmers, researchers
              or enthusiasts that Tweag I/O supports.
