bio: |
  Georgios is a Software Engineer with expertise in the design and
  implementation of functional programming languages. Prior to joining Tweag,
  he was in academia; during that time he designed extensions to Haskell, made
  contributions to GHC, and published his research to top conferences, such as
  ICFP and Haskell Symposium. He holds an MSc in Electrical and Computer
  Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, and a PhD and
  postdoctorate from KU Leuven. Outside of work, Georgios enjoys reading books,
  carving wooden pipes, and hiking in forests and mountains with his wife and
  their dog.
