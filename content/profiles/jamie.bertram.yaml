bio: |
  Jamie grew up in several countries, including Oman, Denmark, and Canada. For
  as long as he can remember, he has had a passion for understanding complicated
  and difficult ideas, and finding the right way to think about them that makes
  them simple. This passion extends to the work he does as a software engineer,
  where he endeavours to find the simple and pure forms of problems that lead
  to natural and solid solutions.

  In addition to this, he has an interest in organizational structures,
  communication, and philosophy. In his free time, he likes to sing in choirs,
  learn theory (of anything), cook, play chess, garden, and spend time with
  friends and family.
