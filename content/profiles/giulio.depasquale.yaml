shortDescription: |
  Giulio is working at Tweag on the Nickel programming language, a
  next-generation configuration language to manage the growing
  complexity of Infrastructure-as-Code and a candidate successor for the
  language Nix.
bio: |
  Always in front of beeping devices, Giulio started his information security career 
  by playing Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions with his alma-mater, Politecnico di Milano.
  He is currently enrolled at King's College London for his PhD in Computer Security
  focusing on binary analysis and obfuscation techniques.

  Constantly researching new technologies to adopt and learn, Giulio enjoys reverse 
  engineering, functional programming and low-level programming languages. In his free time,
  he plays the drums and bass guitar, and he would never refuse a match in a FPS shooter.
