  Daniel is a Data Engineer and new contributor to the Nix ecosystem.
bio: |
  Daniel studied Control Theory, Estimation Theory, and Signal Processing. He
  spent many years, as a Systems Engineer, analyzing, building, and testing
  gimbal stabilized platforms. Following that he spent a few years developing
  Signal Processing and Signal Communications libraries. Now he is passionate
  about creating clear, maintainable, and well tested code in reproducible
  systems. He cares about mentoring, teaching, and making complicated software
  accessible for the end user.
