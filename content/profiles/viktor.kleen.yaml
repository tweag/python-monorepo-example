shortDescription: |
  Viktor is a mathematician turned software engineer. After almost a decade of
  thinking about algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, he joined Tweag in 2022
  to work on more concrete problems.
bio: |
  A computer nerd from childhood, he
  has long been interested in infrastructure as code methods to manage his
  fleet of machines. As a mathematician, he is enamored with functional
  languages and strong type systems as tools to achieve more correct software.
  As a software engineer, he values reproducible and hermetic builds and solid
  developer tooling.

  Viktor is always interested in learning new skills, whether at work or in his
  free time. Find him tinkering with electronics and embedded systems when not
  on the clock.
