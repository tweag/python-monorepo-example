Tweag I/O is inviting applications from students for our internship programme
this summer. If you're a student excited about working with Haskell, nix and
similar things, then get in touch!

The internship would be based at our office in Paris (or remote?) for a period
of up to three months. Timescales are obviously adjustable to suit your needs.
You would need to be eligible to work in the European Union.

Payment/benefits?

Here are some ideas of projects you might like to work on, although you are of
course welcome to suggest others:

- Writing a type system for directory trees for use in
  [funflow](https://github.com/tweag/funflow).
- Writing a monadic streaming JSON parser.
- Write a 'nix' library to produce per-module nix derivations for Haskell
  projects.
- Contribute to fixing bugs in GHC related to static pointers.
- Contribute to fixing bugs in GHC related to inline-java.
- Writing a webapp which allows graphical composition of Funflow workflows.

Here are some previous project which interns have worked on:

- Adding a [type system](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2017-05-23-typing-nix.html)
  to the `nix` language.
- Creating Swarm - one liner to describe it?

If this is something you think would be interested, send us a quick resum√© to
jobs@tweag.io.
