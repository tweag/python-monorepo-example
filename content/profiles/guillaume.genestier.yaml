bio: |
  After an engineering degree in Polytechnique, I was mainly interested in logic and proof theory. I did my PhD in the development team of Dedukti, a logical framework relying on the possibility for the user to encode the logic they want to work with using rewriting rules. Dedukti is designed to enhance interoperability between proof assistants and allow the creation of an encyclopedia of system-independent mechanized proofs. My main subject was to design termination techniques for higher-order rewriting with dependent types, and more specifically for encoding of logics in Dedukti. I also initiated the integration of the Agda proof-assistant into the encyclopedia, by developping Agda2Dedukti, a transpiler of Agda programs into Dedukti.
