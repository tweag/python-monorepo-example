shortDescription: |
  Nicolas is a Software Engineer who works on design, implementation
  and maintenance of micro-services. Before joining Tweag, he worked
  in academia, where he studied automata of many sorts (be they cellular,
  graph-, or tree-). He has a PhD and a MSc in computer science,
  from Université de Caen Normandie
bio: |
  Nicolas enjoys his automata, as they define notions of computation globally,
  rather than with a moving code pointer (so uncivilised!). If you want to learn about
  a variety of exotic, yet Turing-complete collection of computational models, don't
  hesitate to ask him.
  Away from the office, Nicolas is often seen playing {role playing, video, board}-games,
  collecting trivia about law and biology, reading or (tentatively) writing fiction,
  or playing with his cats. But that's the limit of his eclecticism because, when it comes
  to comic books, he only cares about the Franco-Belgian variety.
