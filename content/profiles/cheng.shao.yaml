  Cheng is a Software Engineer who specializes in the implementation
  of functional programming languages. He is the project lead and main
  developer of Tweag's Haskell-to-WebAssembly compiler project
  codenamed Asterius. He also maintains other Haskell projects and
  makes contributions to GHC(Glasgow Haskell Compiler). Outside of
  work, Cheng spends his time exploring Paris and watching anime.
bio: |
  Cheng is a Software Engineer who specializes in the implementation
  of functional programming languages. He has been a late stage
  Haskell addict ever since the first encounter in campus, and he's
  commited to improving the Haskell toolchains and bringing new use
  cases to this language.

  Right before joining Tweag in 2018, Cheng has been following
  developments in the WebAssembly ecosystem, and it looks like
  "compile-once-run-everywhere" but done right in the 21st century,
  bringing exciting use scenarios like web frontends and edge
  computing to all WebAssembly-targetting languages. He started a
  prototype GHC backend which emits WebAssembly, and brought that work
  to Tweag. Since then, he has brought the project from a mere
  prototype to something supporting large codebases. He also managed
  to deepen understanding about internals of the Haskell runtime,
  apply his Haskell expertise to other open source work, and learn
  exciting new technology like Nix.

  Outside of work, Cheng enjoys solitude and entertains through trips
  & anime. Rest assured, conversations featuring either Haskell or
  anime are sufficient to excite him and attract him out from his
  natural habitat.

  Other Tweagers call Cheng a GHC magician and rice chemist, who is always
  eager to learn, as well as discuss and explain what he knows - an incredibly
  generous and highly skilled person!
