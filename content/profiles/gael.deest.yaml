  Gaël is a versatile software engineer with a background in compilers, signal
  processing and hardware design. Before joining Tweag, he received a PhD from
  the University of Rennes 1, where he applied polyhedral compilation techniques
  to the automation of Design-Space Exploration for FPGA accelerators.

  In his spare time, Gaël can be found playing the piano, taking care of his
  dogs, cooking or growing vegetables.
