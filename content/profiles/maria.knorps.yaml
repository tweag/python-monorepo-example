shortDescription: |
  Maria is a mathematician at heart and by education. Before she joined the industry, 
  she worked in academia on untangling two-phase turbulence problems. From there she 
  made a non-Markovian jump to data science and developed interest in functional programming.
bio: |
  Maria's professional goal is to improve the environment by understanding it first in
  the language of mathematics and then applying the gained knowledge.
  After graduating in applied mathematics, Maria began research on the two-phase turbulent flows.
  Knowledge of mathematical modeling helped her better understand the small-scale physical effects 
  and allowed her to more accurately model two-phase turbulence while reducing computational costs.

  After completing her PhD, Maria began to work as a data scientist. 
  She was responsible for all stages of data processing, from creating ETL pipelines, through modeling 
  to visualization of the results and leading 2-5 people projects.
  Being on the implementation and design side of things pushed her towards functional programming. 
  She wrote parts of the data processing pipelines in Haskell, where system of types and expressiveness are 
  closer to the language of mathematics.
  Maria likes to keep the code neat and tidy, ensuring that things are reusable and well documented.

  Diversity in the IT industry and encouraging girls and women to program are matters dear to her heart.
  As a mother of two kids, she doesn't have much time for other hobbies, but ...
  sometimes she jumps on motorcycle and rides outside of the city.
