shortDescription: |
  At Tweag Alexandre brings people together around projetcs. He kick-starts and manages them and is 
  always looking for new opportunties to collaborate. Genuinly curious about "the other" Alexandre has 
  a tendency to fetch and piece together information in a detective-like manner to ensure an optimal 
  engineer-to-project fit in order to maximise value for all parties. 
bio: |
  Alexandre Prestele is a people-centered business developer and partnerships manager
  with a solid track record in building, maintaining and growing sustainable relationships 
  around modern product development and engineering. He holds an M.A. in International Affairs and Governance

  partly with his wife and now 4 year old son. 
  
  He brings a wealth of experience with him in client-facing roles, ranging from customer success, account management,
  business development and strategic partnerships. Prior to working at Tweag, Alexandre worked for top tier cloud integrators
  and innovation studios, developing, growing and driving European-wide partnership programs and opportunities.
  In another life he was active as project developer and coordinator in the arts and branding field in Tokyo. 
  
  Thriving in a multicultural and fast-paced environments, Alexandre likes to work in a team to push forward the mission and
  vision of the companies he is working for and genuinely believes that better, reliable code and a better developer
  experience are key to improve the highly technological world we are living in.
  
  In his free-time, you can find Alexandre trying out a new restaurant, museum or playground or roaming around the
  streets of Paris which never cease to amaze him.
