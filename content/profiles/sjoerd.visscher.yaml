bio: |
  Sjoerd has been an active member of the Haskell community since about 2008
  and has created several packages, mainly in the area of generic programming.
  Sjoerd studied applied math at the University of Twente but quit after 2
  years in 1998 because he found the internet more interesting. Math has been
  a hobby of his ever since, and these days he is mostly interested in
  category theory and its implications on API design and code reuse. When he
  is not working, Sjoerd is bouldering (inside because there arenâ€™t any big
  enough natural boulders in the Netherlands) and sings in a choir. He also
  sometimes composes music and has designed his own isomorphic keyboard.
  Sjoerd lives currently in The Hague with his wife and 2 cats.
