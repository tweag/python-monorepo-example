bio: |
  I am a Software Engineer at Tweag, specialising in the design and implementation of programming languages, development tools, and automation. Prior to joining Tweag, I worked as a Senior Teaching Fellow (equivalent to Assistant Professor, teaching-only) at the University of Warwick during 2017-2021 where I taught modules on Functional Programming (in Haskell) and Cyber Security. During that time, I taught functional programming to close to one thousand students, making extensive use of property-based testing and emphasising the benefits of reusable and strongly typed code. I have a BSc (Hons) Computer Science from the University of Nottingham (2010-2013) where my final year project was about the implementation of a compiler for a Haskell-like language. From 2013, I studied towards a PhD at the University of Cambridge where I worked on encoding an object system in Haskell - which I hope to wrap up in the near future. During my last year at Warwick, I won two departmental teaching awards, one for each of my taught modules, and was a finalist for the university-wide teaching award. Aside from software engineering, I enjoy teaching, cooking, video and board games, walking, ducks, seals, the colour purple (#3D3051 to be exact), and punting.
