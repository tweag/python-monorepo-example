        Open Source Fellowship Research with Richard Eisenberg:
        Working on translation of a type system with refinements to full dependent types. In particular:
          - Developing a prototype implementation compiling a toy language to Idris.
          - Writing a paper, formally defining a surface language with refinement
            types, a core language with PTS-style dependent types, and the
            translation from the former to the latter, defining the notion of
            translation correctness and proving that the proposed translation is
            indeed correct.
          - Formalizing the proposed type system with refinements in Agda.
          - Formally proving in Agda that the proposed type system has the usual
            metatheoretic properties, and that the translation is correct.
