shortDescription: |
  Matthew is a software engineer, (recovering) mathematician and type system
  enthusiast with a decade of experience across a variety of industries and
  technologies. They're also an amateur stand-up comedian, just in case your 
  team is missing one of those.
bio: |
  After graduating from a mathematics degree and narrowly avoiding a career
  in tax accountancy, Matthew taught themselves to code while working as a
  software tester in order to automate a boring & repetitive set of smoke 
  tests. From there, they spent several years building iOS applications,
  had a stint teaching Ruby and JavaScript at a software bootcamp, and somehow
  ended up leading the authentication team for a business with ~75 million 
  monthly active users.

  Matthew cares deeply about software quality, writing maintainable code,
  and efficient software engineering processes. They're also a skilled mentor,
  taking great satisfaction in supporting the development of those around them.

  Over the last few years, Matthew has become particularly interested in 
  programming language design, both from a developer-experience perspective,
  and as an application of the foundational mathematics they studied at university.
  They're excited to work on anything that helps bring advances in type systems 
  into the hands of everyday programmers.

  Outside of work, Matthew enjoys making experimental music, performing 
  experimental stand-up comedy, and eating in fancy experimental restaurants.
  They also play a lot of video games & are always up for a game of Mario Kart.
