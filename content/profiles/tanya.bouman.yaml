  taught Elm and basic computer science concepts to children, and worked on a few research projects at McMaster University.
  Now at Tweag, she works on a web application project and finds interesting new things to learn every day,
  with the community of passionate and helpful Tweagers.

  Outside of work, Tanya enjoys playing the organ or other keyboard instruments, conversations about ethics
