title: Nix on Windows Subsystem for Linux

While testing the 17.09 NixOS release, I had the idea of testing the Nix installation under WSL to see if it worked. And it worked! Success!

So what does this mean?

Maybe you rememeber, the [Windows NT kernel used to have a POSIX layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem). The POSIX layer always had compatibility issues with BSD and Linux software.. The WSL is a revival of that idea but with a specific focus on the Linux ABI. It means that it is now possible to run Linux software natively on Windows. Linux software can execute Windows software and reversely.

It's not perfect yet. I/O and symlink resolution seem to be slow and not all Linux syscalls have been implemented yet. This is more about the promised land that Microsoft is showing, WSL is not availble on the server edition yet, but it looks like they are going to deliver on it.

At Tweag we some times use Nix build system as the foundation to build projects. Nix is a good fit for project who mix different languages. It's really good to provide reproducible builds and compose the various parts of the project with external depeendencies. Unfortunately it is also not supported on Windows so we have to make a decision upfront on whenever Windows is going to become a target platform or not. Thanks to WSL it looks like we will have an escape hatch, at least for non-graphical applications.

Another potential use-case that I see is for Haskell development. Today, a lot of good software is being developed directly on top of Linux and macOS, and Windows is not a prime target anymore. The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is actually quite well behaved on Windows when compiling pure Haskell code. The issue is when binding to C, in that case WSL might just be easier to use.

## How to install

Enable and install WSL following these instructions:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide

Make sure to have the latest version of Windows 10 installed. I had this version at the time of install:

* Windows Edition: Windows 10 Pro
* Windows Version: 1703
* Windows OS Build: 15063.540
* System Type: 64-bit operating system

Start the “Bash On Ubuntu On Windows” program and type `curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh`

## Known issues

### `curl` is hanging

Hit Ctrl+C and retry

### Nix installation crash

Older versions of WSL didn't support all the syscalls needed by Nix. Update Windows and try again.

### `nix-shell` is broken

Fails with synchronous i/o disk error
https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1203

Workaround: edit /etc/nix/nix.conf and add use-sqlite-wal=false

### It’s slow

Yes, especially I/O and symlinks seem to be quite slow. The only solution here is to wait for Microsoft to optimise their syscalls.

### Nix environment is not started in new logins.

Workaround: Run `source ~/.profile`

## Conclusion

For now, it's just a technology preview that opens new possibilities. Hopefully in the future, when I/O gets faster, it will also be enjoyable to develop Linux programs under WSL directly.
