Correct, efficient, and reliable builds are critical for developers to
work and collaborate effectively.

The size and complexity to which a project can grow should not be bounded by its
build system, but by what is best to achieve the goal of the project.

Large codebase or small, polyglot or monolingual, enterprise or open source -
no matter which kind of project, the build system should provide correct,
efficient, reliable builds.
