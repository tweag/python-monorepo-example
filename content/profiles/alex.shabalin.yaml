bio: |
  Alex is a software engineer that professionally grew up in the trading industry writing C++ with a Haskell accent.
  He claims such approach made the business side happy and his previous colleagues (who preferred mutating objects) puzzled.

  Alex has experience working for large and small companies. Over the years,
  his responsibilities included developing apps for a trading platform,
  managing processes around on-device voice recognition and providing reliable gateways to cryptocurrency exchanges.

  He has also lived and worked in different countries which fits well his nomadic character.
  Originally from Russia, he has lived in Amsterdam, then moved to Toronto,
  came back to Amsterdam and next planning to settle in France.

  Now at Tweag, he's looking forward to making good use of his skills.
  Especially, working with Haskell while drawing inspiration from his C++ background
  and being surrounded with like-minded people.
