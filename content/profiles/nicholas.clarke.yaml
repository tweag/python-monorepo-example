bio: |
  Nicolas is a lapsed mathematician and senior software engineer at Tweag, where
  he generally works as a jack of all trades. He has a focus on clean, aesthetic
  code and strong abstraction boundaries. He worked in various roles before
  joining Tweag, from distributed systems to genome informatics and machine
  learning research.

  When outside the office, he can often be found somewhere up a climbing wall,
  on a sailboat, or throwing other people into the air.

      Led a team developing a distributed high availability subsystem for a
      next-generation filesystem. I additionally designed the C&C architecture
      for the prototype archival system running this filesystem, and supervised
      another development team building the system CLI.

      Working in an informatics support team for human genetics research,
      principally developing tools to support replication and guaranteed
      provenance of results generated by cluster pipelines. I also designed and
      implemented algorithms for haplotype phasing and detecting errors in
      sequencing data, and advised on machine learning techniques for quality
      control of genetic calling.
  - employer: HMG
    role: Data Mining Researcher
    years: May 2009 - December 2012
    description: |
      Research into data mining problems, especially developing algorithms to
      infer information from multiple disparate data sources. My main research
      was into graph mining against an internal semantic graph implementation,
      but also included traditional graph mining using Map/Reduce and a version
      of Googleâ€™s Pregel architecture. Further research topics included the use
      of layout algorithms to aid in visualisation and data structures to
      represent temporal and probabilistic information.
