shortDescription: |
  Johan is a Developer Productivity Engineer at Tweag. Originally from Western
  Norway, he is currently based in Delft, NL, and enjoys this opportunity to
  discover the Netherlands and the rest of continental Europe. Johan has almost
  twenty years of industry experience, mostly working with Linux and open
  source software within the embedded realm. He has a passion for designing and
  implementing elegant and useful solutions to challenging problems, and is
  always looking for underlying root causes to the problems that face software
  developers today. Outside of work, he enjoys playing jazz piano and cycling.

bio: |
  After completing a computer engineering degree in Canada, Johan moved to Oslo
  in 2004 and completed two long industry stints, at Opera Software (2004 –
  2011) and Cisco Systems (2011 – 2022). Although both jobs were ostensibly
  focused on programming in C++, Johan found himself gradually moving towards
  the tooling and infrastructure side of things: At Opera, he championed and
  implemented a company-wide migration from CVS to Git, and at Cisco he helped
  a similar migration from Subversion to Git. At both places he taught his
  colleagues how to use Git effectively, and became the de facto in-house Git
  Guru. At Cisco he also delved into the in-house build systems, and helped
  scale them to teams comprising hundreds of developers across many time zones.

  When focusing on the underlying tooling that developers face every day –
  build systems, version control, developer tooling, etc. – Johan has found
  that his efforts can have a multiplicative effect on the productivity of a
  team: making everybody more productive when the tools work well.

  Along the way, Johan has built up expertise in systems programming with
  Python, as well as embedded Linux development in general. These days, he's
  continuing to expand his knowledge in relevant technologies such as Nix and
  Bazel. He has been an open source enthusiast since the late 90s and is
  looking to keep contributing back to the community that has now grown to
  become the backbone of the entire software industry.

  Outside of work, Johan plays the piano, mostly within various jazz genres,
  together with others or by himself. He also enjoys road cycling, and will
  travel with his bike to good cycling destinations. The Pyrenees mountains
  has a special place in his cycling heart.
