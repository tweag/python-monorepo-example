shortDescription: |
  Joe is a programmer and a mathematician. He loves getting lost in new topics
  and is a fervent believer in clear documentation.
bio: |
  Having spending most of his career as an academic mathematician, Joe made
  the leap to Tweag and full-time software development in 2022. An open-source
  hobbyist for decades, he discovered Rust before it hit 1.0 and fell in love
  (or, at least, infatuation). Although he is capable of getting things done,
  Joe also likes to talk and learn about math, software, and the connections
  between them. If you have an hour to spare, try asking him about the math
  behind soap bubble clusters.

  Joe spends most of his non-working hours shuttling his daughters around in
  his bakfiets. People in Texas (where he lives) find this odd, but they seem
  to understand when he points out that it's basically the bicycle equivalent
  of an F-150.
